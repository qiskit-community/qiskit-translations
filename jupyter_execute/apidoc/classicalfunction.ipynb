      "/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.8.7/x64/lib/python3.8/site-packages/qiskit/circuit/register.py:119: DeprecationWarning: `np.int` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `int`. To silence this warning, use `int` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. When replacing `np.int`, you may wish to use e.g. `np.int64` or `np.int32` to specify the precision. If you wish to review your current use, check the release note link for additional information.\n",
