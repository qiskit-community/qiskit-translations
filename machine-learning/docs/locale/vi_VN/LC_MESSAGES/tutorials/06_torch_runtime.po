msgid "In this tutorial, we introduce Torch Runtime, and show how to use it via the ``TorchRuntimeClient`` class in Qiskit Machine Learning. Torch Runtime leverages Qiskit Runtime for hybrid quantum-classical machine learning based on a PyTorch ``Module``. It allows training models or predicting the outputs with trained models significantly faster. We show how to use Torch Runtime with two simple examples for regression and classification tasks in the following."

msgid "Qiskit Machine Learning offers a base hook class, ``HookBase``. It is a base class for a hook that is a set of callback functions used in the training process. Users can implement their own hook classes from this base class to handle complicated callback processes. This structure provides high flexibility in the callback processes. Each hook can implement 6 methods, and each method is called before/after the corresponding processes during training. The way they are called is demonstrated in the following snippet:"
