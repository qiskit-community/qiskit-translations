msgid "Kernel methods are a collection of pattern analysis algorithms that use kernel functions to operate in a high-dimensional feature space. The best-known application of kernel methods is in **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**, supervised learning algorithms commonly used for classification tasks. The main goal of SVMs is to find decision boundaries to separate a given set of data points into classes. When these data spaces are not linearly separable, SVMs can benefit from the use of kernels to find these boundaries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/03_quantum_kernel.ipynb:46
msgid "Formally, decision boundaries are hyperplanes in a high dimensional space. The kernel function implicitly maps input data into this higher dimensional space, where it can be easier to solve the initial problem. In other words, kernels may allow data distributions that were originally non-linearly separable to become a linearly separable problem. This is an effect known as the \"kernel trick\"."
