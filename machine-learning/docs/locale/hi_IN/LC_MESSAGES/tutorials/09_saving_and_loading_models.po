msgid "In this tutorial we will show how to save and load Qiskit machine learning models. Ability to save a model is very important, especially when a significant amount of time is invested in training a model on a real hardware. Also, we will show how to resume training of the previously saved model."

msgid "Next step is to prepare a dataset. Here, we generate some data in the same way as in other tutorials. The difference is that we apply some transformations to the generated data. We generates ``40`` samples, each sample has ``2`` features, so our features is an array of shape ``(40, 2)``. Labels are obtained by summing up features by columns and if the sum is more than ``1`` then this sample is labeled as ``1`` and ``0`` otherwise."

#: ../../tutorials/09_saving_and_loading_models.ipynb:114

msgid "We choose ``VQC`` or Variational Quantum Classifier as a model we will train. This model, by default, takes one-hot encoded labels, so we have to transform the labels that are in the set of ``{0, 1}`` into one-hot representation. We employ SciKit-Learn for this transformation as well. Please note that the input array must be reshaped to ``(num_samples, 1)`` first. The ``OneHotEncoder`` encoder does not work with 1D arrays and our labels is a 1D array. In this case a user must decide either an array has only one feature(our case!) or has one sample. Also, by default the encoder returns sparse arrays, but for dataset plotting it is easier to have dense arrays, so we set ``sparse`` to ``False``."

We also set the ``sampler`` property of the underlying network to the second instance of the ``Sampler`` primitive we created in the beginning of the tutorial. Finally, we create and set a new optimizer with ``maxiter`` is set to ``80``, so the total number of iterations is ``100``."
