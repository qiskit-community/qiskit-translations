msgid "This notebook demonstrates the different generic quantum neural network (QNN) implementations provided in Qiskit Machine Learning. The networks are meant as application-agnostic computational units that can be used for many different use cases. Depending on the application, a particular type of network might more or less suitable and might require to be set up in a particular way. The following different available neural networks will now be discussed in more detail:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/01_neural_networks.ipynb:66
msgid "The ``NeuralNetwork`` represents the interface for all neural networks available in Qiskit Machine Learning. It exposes a forward and a backward pass taking the data samples and trainable weights as input. A ``NeuralNetwork`` does not contain any training capabilities, these are pushed to the actual algorithms / applications. Thus, a ``NeuralNetwork`` also does not store the values for trainable weights. In the following, different implementations of this interfaces are introduced."

#: ../../tutorials/01_neural_networks.ipynb:68
msgid "Suppose a ``NeuralNetwork`` called ``nn``. Then, the ``nn.forward(input, weights)`` pass takes either flat inputs for the data and weights of size ``nn.num_inputs`` and ``nn.num_weights``, respectively. ``NeuralNetwork`` supports batching of inputs and returns batches of output of the corresponding shape."

#: ../../tutorials/01_neural_networks.ipynb:82
msgid "The ``OpflowQNN`` takes a (parametrized) operator from Qiskit and leverages Qiskit’s gradient framework to provide the backward pass. Such an operator can for instance be an expected value of a quantum mechanical observable with respect to a parametrized quantum state. The Parameters can be used to load classical data as well as represent trainable weights. The ``OpflowQNN`` also allows lists of operators and more complex structures to construct more complex QNNs."

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/01_neural_networks.ipynb:614
msgid "The ``CircuitQNN`` is based on a (parametrized) ``QuantumCircuit``. This can take input as well as weight parameters and produces samples from the measurement. The samples can either be interpreted as probabilities of measuring the integer index corresponding to a bitstring or directly as a batch of binary output. In the case of probabilities, gradients can be estimated efficiently and the ``CircuitQNN`` provides a backward pass as well. In case of samples, differentiation is not possible and the backward pass returns ``(None, None)``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/01_neural_networks.ipynb:617
msgid "Further, the ``CircuitQNN`` allows to specify an ``interpret`` function to post-process the samples. This is expected to take a measured integer (from a bitstring) and map it to a new index, i.e. non-negative integer. In this case, the output shape needs to be provided and the probabilities are aggregated accordingly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/01_neural_networks.ipynb:619
msgid "A ``CircuitQNN`` can be configured to return sparse as well as dense probability vectors. If no ``interpret`` function is used, the dimension of the probability vector scales exponentially with the number of qubits and a sparse recommendation is usually recommended. In case of an ``interpret`` function it depends on the expected outcome. If, for instance, an index is mapped to the parity of the corresponding bitstring, i.e., to 0 or 1, a dense output makes sense and the result will be a probability vector of length 2."
