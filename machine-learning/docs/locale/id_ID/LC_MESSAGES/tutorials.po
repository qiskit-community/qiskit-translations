#: ../../tutorials/05_torch_connector.ipynb:264
msgid "**💡 Clarification :** In classical machine learning, the general rule of thumb is to apply a Cross-Entropy loss to classification tasks, and MSE loss to regression tasks. However, this recommendation is given under the assumption that the output of the classification network is a class probability value in the [0,1] range (usually this is achieved through a Softmax layer). Because the following example for ``TwoLayerQNN`` does not include such layer, and we don’t apply any mapping to the output (the following section shows an example of application of parity mapping with ``CircuitQNNs``), the QNN’s output can take any value in the range [-1,1]. In case you were wondering, this is the reason why this particular example uses MSELoss for classification despite it not being the norm (but we encourage you to experiment with different loss functions and see how they can impact training results)."
