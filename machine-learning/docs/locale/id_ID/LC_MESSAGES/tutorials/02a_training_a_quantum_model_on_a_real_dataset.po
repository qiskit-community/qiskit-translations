msgid "This tutorial will demonstrate how to train a quantum machine learning model to tackle a classification problem. Previous tutorials have featured small, artificial datasets. Here we will increase the problem complexity by considering a real-life classical dataset. We decided to pick a very well-known – albeit still relatively small – problem: the Iris flower dataset. This dataset even has its own Wikipedia `page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set>`__. Although the Iris dataset is well known to data scientists, we will briefly introduce it to refresh our memories. For comparison, we'll first train a classical counterpart to the quantum model."

msgid "Our data is classical, meaning it consists of a set of bits, not qubits. We need a way to encode the data as qubits. This process is crucial if we want to obtain an effective quantum model. We usually refer to this mapping as data encoding, data embedding, or data loading and this is the role of the feature map. While feature mapping is a common ML mechanism, this process of loading data into quantum states does not appear in classical machine learning as that only operates in the classical world."

msgid "Once the data is loaded, we must immediately apply a parameterized quantum circuit. This circuit is a direct analog to the layers in classical neural networks. It has a set of tunable parameters or weights. The weights are optimized such that they minimize an objective function. This objective function characterizes the distance between the predictions and known labeled data. A parameterized quantum circuit is also called a parameterized trial state, variational form, or ansatz. Perhaps, the latter is the most widely used term."

We create an instance of the ``Sampler`` primitive. This is the reference implementation that is statevector based. Using qiskit runtime services you can create a sampler that is backed by a quantum computer."
msgstr ""

msgid "We will add a callback function called ``callback_graph``. ``VQC`` will call this function for each evaluation of the objective function with two parameters: the current weights and the value of the objective function at those weights. Our callback will append the value of the objective function to an array so we can plot the iteration versus the objective function value. The callback will update the plot at each iteration. Note that you can do whatever you want inside a callback function, so long as it has the two-parameter signature we mentioned above."

In the simplest case it is enough to pass the number of qubits and a quantum instance to construct a valid classifier.

msgid "The key components are the feature map and the ansatz. You can tweak parameters. In our case, you may change the ``reps`` parameter that specifies how repetitions of a gate pattern we add to the circuit. Larger values lead to more entanglement operations and more parameters. Thus, the model can be more flexible, but the higher number of parameters also adds complexity, and training such a model usually takes more time. Furthermore, we may end up overfitting the model. You can try the other feature maps and ansatzes available in the `Qiskit circuit library <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html#n-local-circuits>`__, or you can come up with custom circuits."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/02a_training_a_quantum_model_on_a_real_dataset.ipynb:814
msgid "You may try other optimizers. Qiskit contains a bunch of them. Some of them are gradient-free, others not. If you choose a gradient-based optimizer, e.g., ``L_BFGS_B``, expect the training time to increase. Additionally to the objective function, these optimizers must evaluate the gradient with respect to the training parameters, which leads to an increased number of circuit executions per iteration."

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/02a_training_a_quantum_model_on_a_real_dataset.ipynb:968

msgid "Well, the scores are higher than a fair coin toss but could be better. The objective function is almost flat towards the end, meaning increasing the number of iterations won't help, and model performance will stay the same. Let's see what we can do with another ansatz."

#: ../../tutorials/02a_training_a_quantum_model_on_a_real_dataset.ipynb:1301
msgid "Unsurprisingly, the classical models perform better than their quantum counterparts, but classical ML has come a long way, and quantum ML has yet to reach that level of maturity. As we can see, we achieved the best results using a classical support vector machine. But the quantum model trained on four features was also quite good. When we reduced the number of features, the performance of all models went down as expected. So, if resources permit training a model on a full-featured dataset without any reduction, you should train such a model. If not, you may expect to compromise between dataset size, training time, and score."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/02a_training_a_quantum_model_on_a_real_dataset.ipynb:1304
msgid "Another observation is that even a simple ansatz change can lead to better results. The two-feature model with the ``EfficientSU2`` ansatz performs better than the one with ``RealAmplitudes``. That means the choice of hyperparameters plays the same critical role in quantum ML as in classical ML, and searching for optimal hyperparameters may take a long time. You may apply the same techniques we use in classical ML, such as random/grid or more sophisticated approaches."
