msgid "The qGAN [1] is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm used for generative modeling tasks. The algorithm uses the interplay of a quantum generator :math:`G_{\\theta}`, i.e., an ansatz (parametrized quantum circuit), and a classical discriminator :math:`D_{\\phi}`, a neural network, to learn the underlying probability distribution given training data."

#: ../../tutorials/04_torch_qgan.ipynb:31
msgid "The generator and discriminator are trained in alternating optimization steps, where the generator aims at generating probabilities that will be classified by the discriminator as training data values (i.e, probabilities from the real training distribution), and the discriminator tries to differentiate between original distribution and probabilities from the generator (in other words, telling apart the real and generated distributions). The final goal is for the quantum generator to learn a representation for the target probability distribution. The trained quantum generator can, thus, be used to load a quantum state which is an approximate model of the target distribution."
