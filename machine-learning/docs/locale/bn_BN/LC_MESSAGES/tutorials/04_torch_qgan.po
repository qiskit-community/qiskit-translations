msgid "The qGAN [1] is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm used for generative modeling tasks. The algorithm uses the interplay of a quantum generator :math:`G_{\\theta}`, i.e., an ansatz, and a classical discriminator :math:`D_{\\phi}`, a neural network, to learn the underlying probability distribution given training data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/04_torch_qgan.ipynb:21
msgid "The generator and discriminator are trained in alternating optimization steps, where the generator aims at generating samples that will be classified by the discriminator as training data samples (i.e, samples extracted from the real training distribution), and the discriminator tries to differentiate between original training data samples and data samples from the generator (in other words, telling apart the real and generated distributions). The final goal is for the quantum generator to learn a representation for the training data’s underlying probability distribution. The trained quantum generator can, thus, be used to load a quantum state which is an approximate model of the target distribution."

msgid "Quantum generative adversarial networks employ the interplay of a generator and discriminator to map an approximate representation of a probability distribution underlying given data samples into a quantum channel. This tutorial presents a self-standing PyTorch-based qGAN implementation where the generator is given by a quantum channel, i.e., a variational quantum circuit, and the discriminator by a classical neural network, and discusses the application of efficient learning and loading of generic probability distributions – implicitly given by data samples – into quantum states. Since, this approximate loading requires only :math:`\\mathscr{O}\\left(poly\\left(n\\right)\\right)` gates and can enable the use of potentially advantageous quantum algorithms by offering an efficient data loading scheme."
