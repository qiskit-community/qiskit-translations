msgid "Qiskit Machine Learning depends on Qiskit, which has its own `Qiskit Getting Started <https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html>`__ detailing installation options and its supported environments/platforms. You should refer to that first. Then the information here can be followed which focuses on the additional installation specific to Qiskit Machine Learning."
