msgid "In this tutorial we show how the ``NeuralNetworkClassifier`` and ``NeuralNetworkRegressor`` are used. Both take as an input a (Quantum) ``NeuralNetwork`` and leverage it in a specific context. In both cases we also provide a pre-configured variant for convenience, the Variational Quantum Classifier (``VQC``) and Variational Quantum Regressor (``VQR``). The tutorial is structured as follows:"

msgid "First we show how an ``EstimatorQNN`` can be used for classification within a ``NeuralNetworkClassifier``. In this context, the ``EstimatorQNN`` is expected to return one-dimensional output in :math:`[-1, +1]`. This only works for binary classification and we assign the two classes to :math:`\\{-1, +1\\}`. To simplify the composition of parameterized quantum circuit from a feature map and an ansatz we can use the ``QNNCircuit`` class."

msgid "We will add a callback function called ``callback_graph``. This will be called for each iteration of the optimizer and will be passed two parameters: the current weights and the value of the objective function at those weights. For our function, we append the value of the objective function to an array so we can plot iteration versus objective function value and update the graph with each iteration. However, you can do whatever you want with a callback function as long as it gets the two parameters mentioned passed."

msgid "Next we show how a ``SamplerQNN`` can be used for classification within a ``NeuralNetworkClassifier``. In this context, the ``SamplerQNN`` is expected to return :math:`d`-dimensional probability vector as output, where :math:`d` denotes the number of classes. The underlying ``Sampler`` primitive returns quasi-distributions of bit strings and we just need to define a mapping from the measured bitstrings to the different classes. For binary classification we use the parity mapping. Again we can use the ``QNNCircuit`` class to set up a parameterized quantum circuit from a feature map and ansatz of our choice."

msgid "Again, once the model is trained we can take a look at the weights. As we set ``reps=1`` explicitly in our ansatz, we can see less parameters than in the previous model."

#: ../../tutorials/02_neural_network_classifier_and_regressor.ipynb:646
msgid "The ``VQC`` is a special variant of the ``NeuralNetworkClassifier`` with a ``SamplerQNN``. It applies a parity mapping (or extensions to multiple classes) to map from the bitstring to the classification, which results in a probability vector, which is interpreted as a one-hot encoded result. By default, it applies this the ``CrossEntropyLoss`` function that expects labels given in one-hot encoded format and will return predictions in that format too."

msgid "In this section we generate an artificial dataset that contains samples of three classes and show how to train a model to classify this dataset. This example shows how to tackle more interesting problems in machine learning. Of course, for a sake of short training time we prepare a tiny dataset. We employ ``make_classification`` from SciKit-Learn to generate a dataset. There 10 samples in the dataset, 2 features, that means we can still have a nice plot of the dataset, as well as no redundant features, these are features are generated as a combinations of the other features. Also, we have 3 different classes in the dataset, each classes one kind of centroid and we set class separation to ``2.0``, a slight increase from the default value of ``1.0`` to ease the classification problem."
