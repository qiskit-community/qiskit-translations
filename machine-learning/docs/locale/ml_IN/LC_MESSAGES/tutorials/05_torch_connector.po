msgid "This tutorial introduces Qiskit's ``TorchConnector`` class, and demonstrates how the ``TorchConnector`` allows for a natural integration of any ``NeuralNetwork`` from Qiskit Machine Learning into a PyTorch workflow. ``TorchConnector`` takes a Qiskit ``NeuralNetwork`` and makes it available as a PyTorch ``Module``. The resulting module can be seamlessly incorporated into PyTorch classical architectures and trained jointly without additional considerations, enabling the development and testing of novel **hybrid quantum-classical** machine learning architectures."

Some of the most famous algorithms used in popular machine learning architectures include *Adam*, *SGD*, or *Adagrad*. However, for this tutorial we will be using the L-BFGS algorithm (``torch.optim.LBFGS``), one of the most well know second-order optimization algorithms for numerical optimization."

#: ../../tutorials/05_torch_connector.ipynb:272
msgid "**üí° Clarification :** In classical machine learning, the general rule of thumb is to apply a Cross-Entropy loss to classification tasks, and MSE loss to regression tasks. However, this recommendation is given under the assumption that the output of the classification network is a class probability value in the :math:`[0, 1]` range (usually this is achieved through a Softmax layer). Because the following example for ``EstimatorQNN`` does not include such layer, and we don't apply any mapping to the output (the following section shows an example of application of parity mapping with ``SamplerQNN``\\ s), the QNN's output can take any value in the range :math:`[-1, 1]`. In case you were wondering, this is the reason why this particular example uses MSELoss for classification despite it not being the norm (but we encourage you to experiment with different loss functions and see how they can impact training results)."
