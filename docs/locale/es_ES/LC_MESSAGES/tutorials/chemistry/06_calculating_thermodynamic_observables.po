msgid "To compute thermodynamic observables we begin with single point energy calculation which calculates the wavefunction and charge density and therefore the energy of a particular arrangement of nuclei. Here we compute the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface of a hydrogen molecule, as an example, which is simply the electronic energy as a function of bond length."

msgid "The Born-Oppeheimer approximation removes internuclear vibrations from the molecular Hamiltonian and the energy computed from quantum mechanical ground-state energy calculations using this approximation contain only the electronic energy. Since even at absolute zero internuclear vibrations still occur, a correction is required to obtain the true zero-temperature energy of a molecule. This correction is called the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE), which is computed by summing the contribution from internuclear vibrational modes. Therefore, the next step in computing thermodynamic observables is determining the vibrational energy levels. This can be done by constructing the Hessian matrix based on computed single point energies close to the equilibrium bond length. The eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix can then be used to determine the vibrational energy levels and the zero-point vibrational energy"
