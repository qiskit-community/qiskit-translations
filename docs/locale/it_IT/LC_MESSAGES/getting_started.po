msgid "Qiskit strives to support as many platforms as possible, but due to limitations in available testing resources and platform availability, not all platforms can be supported. Platform support for Qiskit is broken into 3 tiers with different levels of support for each tier. For platforms outside these, Qiskit is probably still installable, but it's not tested and you will have to build Qiskit (and likely Qiskit's dependencies) from source."
