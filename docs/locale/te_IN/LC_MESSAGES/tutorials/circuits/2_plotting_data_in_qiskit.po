msgid "The ``plot_histogram()`` has a few options to adjust the output graph. The first option is the ``legend`` kwarg. This is used to provide a label for the executions. It takes a list of strings used to label each execution's results. This is mostly useful when plotting multiple execution results in the same histogram. The ``sort`` kwarg is used to adjust the order the bars in the histogram are rendered. It can be set to either ascending order with ``asc`` or descending order with ``desc``. The ``number_to_keep`` kwarg takes an integer for the number of terms to show, the rest are grouped together in a single bar called rest. You can adjust the color of the bars with the ``color`` kwarg which either takes a string or a list of strings for the colors to use for the bars for each execution. You can adjust whether labels are printed above the bars or not with the ``bar_labels`` kwarg. The last option available is the ``figsize`` kwarg which takes a tuple of the size in inches to make the output figure."

However, the ``matplotlib.Figure`` class natively has methods to both display and save the visualization. You can call ``.show()`` on the returned object from ``plot_histogram()`` to open the image in a new window (assuming your configured matplotlib backend is interactive). Or alternatively you can call ``.savefig('out.png')`` to save the figure to ``out.png``. The ``savefig()`` method takes a path so you can adjust the location and filename where you're saving the output."
