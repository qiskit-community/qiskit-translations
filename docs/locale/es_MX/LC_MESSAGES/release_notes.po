Previously, the ``cvx`` fitter method was used whenever `cvxpy <https://www.cvxpy.org/>`__ was installed. However, it was possible to install cvxpy without an SDP solver that would work for the ``cvx`` fitter method. This logic has been reworked so that the ``cvx`` fitter method is only used if ``cvxpy`` is installed and an SDP solver is present that can be used. Otherwise, the ``lstsq`` fitter is used."
