msgid "`Shor’s Factoring algorithm <https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.algorithms.Shor.html>`__ is one of the most well-known quantum algorithms and finds the prime factors for input integer :math:`N` in polynomial time. The algorithm implementation in Qiskit is simply provided a target integer to be factored and run, as follows:"

msgid "Note: this implementation of Shor’s algorithm uses :math:`4n + 2` qubits, where :math:`n` is the number of bits representing the integer in binary. So in practice, for now, this implementation is restricted to factorizing small integers. Given the above value of N we compute :math:`4n +2` below and confirm the size from the actual circuit."
