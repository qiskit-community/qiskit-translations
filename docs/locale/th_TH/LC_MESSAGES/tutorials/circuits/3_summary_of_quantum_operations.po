For instance, if the first qubit is in state :math:`\\left|0\\right\\rangle` and second is in state :math:`\\left|1\\right\\rangle`, their joint state would be :math:`\\left|01\\right\\rangle`. Qiskit uses a slightly different ordering of the qubits, in which the qubits are represented from the most significant bit (MSB) on the left to the least significant bit (LSB) on the right (little-endian). This is similar to bitstring representation on classical computers, and enables easy conversion from bitstrings to integers after measurements are performed. For the example just given, the joint state would be represented as :math:`\\left|10\\right\\rangle`.

msgid "U can be implemented as a “quantum multiplexor” gate, since it is a block diagonal matrix. In the quantum multiplexor formalism, a block diagonal matrix of size :math:`2^n \\times 2^n`, and consisting of :math:`2^s` blocks, is equivalent to a multiplexor with :math:`s` select qubits and :math:`n-s` data qubits. Depending on the state of the select qubits, the corresponding blocks are applied to the data qubits. A multiplexor of this kind can be implemented after recursive decomposition to primitive gates of cx, rz and ry."
