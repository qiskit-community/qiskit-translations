msgid "The main location for local configuration of Qiskit is the user config file. This is an `ini <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`__  format file that can be used to change defaults in Qiskit."

msgid "For example:"

msgid "By default this file lives in ``~/.qiskit/settings.conf`` but the path used can be overriden with the ``QISKIT_SETTINGS`` environment variable. If ``QISKIT_SETTINGS`` is set its value will used as the path to the user config file."

#: ../../configuration.rst:35
msgid "``circuit_drawer``: This is used to change the default backend for the circuit drawer :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` and :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`. It can be set to ``latex``, ``mpl``, ``text``, or ``latex_source`` and when the ``ouptut`` kwarg is not explicitly set that drawer backend will be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:40
msgid "``circuit_mpl_style``: This is the default style sheet used for the ``mpl`` output backend for the circuit drawer :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` and :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`. It can be set to ``default`` or ``bw``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:45
msgid "``circuit_mpl_style_path``: This can be used to set the path(s) to have the circuit drawer, :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` or :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`, use to look for json style sheets when using the ``mpl`` output mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:49
msgid "``state_drawer``: This is used to change the default backend for the state visualization draw methods :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector.draw` and :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix.draw`. It can be set to ``repr``, ``text``', ``latex``, ``latex_source``, ``qsphere``, ``hinton``, or bloch ``bloch`` and when the ``output`` kwarg is not explicitly set on the :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix.draw` method that output method will be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:56
msgid "``transpile_optimization_level``: This takes an integer between 0-3 and is used to change the default optimization level for :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` and :func:`~qiskit.execute.execute`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:59
msgid "``parallel``: This option takes a boolean value (either ``True`` or ``False``) and is used to configure whether `Python multiprocessing <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html>`__ is enabled for operations that support running in parallel (for example transpilation of multiple :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` objects). The default setting in the user config file can be overriden by the ``QISKIT_PARALLEL`` environment variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:66
msgid "``num_processes``: This option takes an integer value (> 0) that is used to specify the maximum number of parallel processes to launch for parallel operations if parallel execution is enabled. The default setting in the user config file can be overriden by the ``QISKIT_NUM_PROCS`` environment variable."

msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:78
msgid "``QISKIT_PARALLEL``: if this variable is set to ``TRUE`` it will enable the use of `Python multiprocessing <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html>`__ to parallelize certain operations (for example transpilation over multiple circuits) in Qiskit Terra."
msgstr ""

msgid "``QISKIT_NUM_PROCS``: Specifies the maximum number of parallel processes to launch for parallel operations if parallel execution is enabled. It takes an integer > 0 as the expected value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:86
msgid "``RAYON_NUM_THREADS``: Specifies the number of threads to run multithreaded operations in Qiskit Terra. By default this multithreaded code will launch a thread for each logical CPU, if you'd like to adjust the number of threads Qiskit will use you can set this to an integer value. For example, setting ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4`` will only launch 4 threads for multithreaded functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:92
msgid "``QISKIT_FORCE_THREADS``: Specify that multithreaded code should always execute in multiple threads. By default if you're running multithreaded code in a section of Qiskit that is already running in parallel processes Qiskit will not launch multiple threads and instead execute that function serially. This is done to avoid potentially overloading limited CPU resources. However, if you would like to force the use of multiple threads even when in a multiprocess context you can set ``QISKIT_FORCE_THREADS=TRUE`` to do this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:99
msgid "``QISKIT_IBMQ_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL``: Specifies the log level to use, for the ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` modules. If an invalid level is set, the log level defaults to WARNING. The valid log levels are ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR``, and ``CRITICAL`` (case-insensitive). If the environment variable is not set, then the parent loggerâ€™s level is used, which also defaults to ``WARNING``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:105
msgid "``QISKIT_IBMQ_PROVIDER_LOG_FILE``: Specifies the name of the log file to use from log messages originating from ``qiskit-ibmq-provider``. If specified, messages will be logged to the file only. Otherwise messages will be logged to the standard error (usually the screen)."

#: ../../configuration.rst:109
msgid "``QISKIT_AQUA_MAX_GATES_PER_JOB``: An optional parameter to set a threshold for splitting Aqua generated circuits up into multiple jobs submitted to a backend based on the number of gates."
