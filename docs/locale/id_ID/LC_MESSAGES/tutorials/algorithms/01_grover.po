msgid "Grover's algorithm is one of the most famous quantum algorithms introduced by Lov Grover in 1996 `1 <L.%20K.%20Grover,%20A%20fast%20quantum%20mechanical%20algorithm%20for%20database%20search.%20Proceedings%2028th%20Annual%20Symposium%20on>`__. It has initially been proposed for unstructured search problems, i.e. for finding a marked element in a unstructured database. However, Grover's algorithm is now a subroutine to several other algorithms, such as Grover Adaptive Search `2 <A.%20Gilliam,%20S.%20Woerner,%20C.%20Gonciulea,%20Grover%20Adaptive%20Search%20for%20Constrained%20Polynomial%20Binary%20Optimization.>`__.
