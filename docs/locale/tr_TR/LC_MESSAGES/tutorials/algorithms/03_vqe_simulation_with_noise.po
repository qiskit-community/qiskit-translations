msgid "This notebook demonstrates using the `Qiskit Aer <https://qiskit.org/aer>`__ ``qasm_simulator`` to run a simulation with noise, based on a given noise model. This can be useful to investigate behavior under different noise conditions. Aer not only allows you to define your own custom noise model, but also allows a noise model to be easily created based on the properties of a real quantum device. The latter is what this notebook will demonstrate since the goal is to show VQE with noise and not the more complex task of how to build custom noise models."

This solution is leveraged by the ``QuantumInstance`` module which allows any algorithm using it to automatically have measurement noise mitigation applied."

I have created the backend and QuantumInstance, which holds the backend as well as various other run time configuration, which are defaulted here, so it easy to compare when we get to the next section where noise is added. There is no attempt to mitigate noise or anything in this notebook so the latter setup and running of VQE is identical."

While we could leave the simulator with the default all to all map, this shows how to set the coupling map too. Note: We can also use this coupling map as the entanglement map for the variational form if we choose."

msgid "We produced a reference value using a classical algorithm and then proceeded to run VQE on a qasm simulator. While the simulation is ideal (no noise) there is so called shot-noise due to sampling - increasing the number of shots reduces this as more and more samples are taken, but shots was left at the default of 1024 and we see a small effect in the outcome."
