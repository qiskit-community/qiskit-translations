msgid "This notebook shows how to use the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) objective function introduced in [1] within the variational quantum optimization algorithms provided by Qiskit. Particularly, it is shown how to setup the ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` using ``VQE`` accordingly. For a given set of shots with corresponding objective values of the considered optimization problem, the CVaR with confidence level :math:`\\alpha \\in [0, 1]` is defined as the average of the :math:`\\alpha` best shots. Thus, :math:`\\alpha = 1` corresponds to the standard expected value, while :math:`\\alpha=0` corresponds to the minimum of the given shots, and :math:`\\alpha \\in (0, 1)` is a tradeoff between focusing on better shots, but still applying some averaging to smoothen the optimization landscape."
