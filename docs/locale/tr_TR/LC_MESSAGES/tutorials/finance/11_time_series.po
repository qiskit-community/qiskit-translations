msgid "Across many problems in finance, one starts with time series. Here, we showcase how to generate pseudo-random time-series, download actual stock-market time series from a number of common providers, and how to compute time-series similarity measures."

msgid "Once the data are loaded, you can run a variety of algorithms on those to aggregate the data. Notably, you can compute the covariance matrix or a variant, which would consider alternative time-series similarity measures based on dynamic time warping (DTW). In DTW, changes that vary in speed, e.g., one stock's price following another stock's price with a small delay, can be accommodated."
