What previously has been referred to as Qiskit Aqua, the single applications and algorithms module of Qiskit, is now split into dedicated application modules for Optimization, Finance, Machine Learning and Nature (including Physics & Chemistry). The core algorithms and opflow operator functionality are moved to Qiskit Terra."
