"Most quantum algorithms can be described with circuit operations alone. "
"When we need more control over the low-level implementation of our "
"program, we can use *pulse gates*. Pulse gates remove the constraint of "
"executing circuits with basis gates only, and also allow you to override "
"the default implementation of any basis gate."

"Pulse gates allow you to map a logical circuit gate (e.g., ``X``) to a "
"Qiskit Pulse program, called a ``Schedule``. This mapping is referred to "
"as a *calibration*. A high fidelity calibration is one which faithfully "
"implements the logical operation it is mapped from (e.g., whether the "
"``X`` gate calibration drives :math:`|0\\rangle` to :math:`|1\\rangle`, "
"etc.)."

"A schedule specifies the exact time dynamics of the input signals across "
"all input *channels* to the device. There are usually multiple channels "
"per qubit, such as drive and measure. This interface is more powerful, "
"and requires a deeper understanding of the underlying device physics."

"It’s important to note that Pulse programs operate on physical qubits. A "
"drive pulse on qubit :math:`a` will not enact the same logical operation "
"on the state of qubit :math:`b` – in other words, gate calibrations are "
"not interchangeable across qubits. This is in contrast to the circuit "
"level, where an ``X`` gate is defined independent of its qubit operand."

"The ``gate`` can either be a ``circuit.Gate`` object or the name of the "
