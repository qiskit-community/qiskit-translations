"We’ll use the mocked backend, ``FakeAlmaden``, to demonstrate how to use "
"the scheduler. It contains default calibrations for measurement and for "
"its basis gates. The Hadamard operation is not one of those basis gates, "

"That covers the basics! We used the transpiler to rewrite the circuit in "

"The scheduler can follow multiple routines. By default, it follows an *as"

"possible*, (ASAP). For both methods, the output schedule is minimal: in "
"the longest-duration operation path of the input circuit, the start time "
"of each operation is the end time of the proceeding operation. The "
"methods determine how to schedule operations outside that longest path."

"For our mocked backend, these :math:`X` gate operations are each the same"
" duration (``duration = 160 dt``). For the schedule to be minimal, the "
"two :math:`X` operations on qubit 0 will be scheduled back-to-back, and "

"ALAP will choose the latest valid time to schedule lesser-constrained "

"On the other hand, as the name suggests, ASAP will schedule operations as"
" soon as its resources are free. Thus, the :math:`X` gate on qubit 1 will"
" be scheduled at ``time=0``, in sync with the first :math:`X` gate on "
"qubit 0."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/circuits_advanced/10_pulse_scheduler.ipynb:597
msgid ""
"ALAP is the default because it allows qubits to remain idle as long as "
"possible. In this case, the difference between ALAP and ASAP may be "
"negligible, but in ALAP, qubit 0 has *no* time to decay from the excited "
"state before measurement."
