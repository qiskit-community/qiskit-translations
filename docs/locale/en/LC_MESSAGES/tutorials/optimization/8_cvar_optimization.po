"This notebook shows how to use the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) "
"objective function introduced in [1] within the variational quantum "
"optimization algorithms provided by Qiskit. Particularly, it is shown how"
" to setup the ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` using ``VQE`` accordingly. For a "
"given set of shots with corresponding objective values of the considered "
"optimization problem, the CVaR with confidence level :math:`\\alpha \\in "
"[0, 1]` is defined as the average of the :math:`\\alpha` best shots. "
"Thus, :math:`\\alpha = 1` corresponds to the standard expected value, "
"while :math:`\\alpha=0` corresponds to the minimum of the given shots, "
"and :math:`\\alpha \\in (0, 1)` is a tradeoff between focusing on better "
"shots, but still applying some averaging to smoothen the optimization "
"landscape."
