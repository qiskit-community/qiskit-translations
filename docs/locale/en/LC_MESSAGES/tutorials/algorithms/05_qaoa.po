"The brute-force method is as follows. Basically, we exhaustively try all "
"the binary assignments. In each binary assignment, the entry of a vertex "
"is either 0 (meaning the vertex is in the first partition) or 1 (meaning "
"the vertex is in the second partition). We print the binary assignment "
"that satisfies the definition of the graph partition and corresponds to "
"the minimal number of crossing edges."

"The graph partition problem can be converted to an Ising Hamiltonian. "
"Qiskit has different capabilities in the Optimization module to do this. "
"Here, since the goal is to show QAOA, the module is used without further "
"explanation to create the operator. The paper `Ising formulations of many"
" NP problems <https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5843>`__ may be of interest if "
"you would like to understand the technique further."

"The outcome can be seen to match to the value computed above by brute "
