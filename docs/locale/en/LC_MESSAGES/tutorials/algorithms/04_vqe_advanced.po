"The ``initial_point`` parameter allows the optimization to begin at the "
"given point, where the point is a list of parameters that will configure "
"the ansatz. By default the initial point is ``None`` which means that VQE"
" will choose one. The choice in in this case is if the supplied ansatz "
"has a preferred point, based on the initial state provided to it, then "
"this will be chosen, otherwise a random initial point that fits with any "
"bounds the ansatz has will be chosen. If an initial point is supplied it "
"will take priority though and be used - note though it must match in "
"length to the number of parameters in the ansatz circuit."

" the distance changes are small we expect the solution to still be nearby"

msgid ""
"The energy of the Hamiltonian operator that VQE is working on is the "
"expectation value when evaluated with the parameterized ansatz. To "
"compute the expectation value VQE uses an instance of an `expectation "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/qiskit.opflow.expectations.html>`__"
" object. Such an instance may be supplied via the ``expectation`` "
"parameter, or in the default case, where it has a value of ``None``, VQE "
"will use the `ExpectationFactory "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.opflow.expectations.ExpectationFactory.html>`__"
" to create itself a suitable instance based on the supplied backend."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/algorithms/04_vqe_advanced.ipynb:265
msgid ""
"For most cases letting VQE create a suitable instance is sufficient. "
"However the Qiskit Aer aer_simulator supports a snapshot instruction that"
" can be used in conjunction with the operator expectation computation. If"
" used then the outcome is ideal, i.e. like the statevector simulator, and"
" has no shot noise. Since people normally choose the aer_simulator to "
"have shot noise (sampling noise), and be more like a real-device outcome,"
" VQE has an ``include_custom`` flag that is passed on to the "
"ExpectationFactory. When using Aer qasm simulator, and this is set "
"``True``, the factory will return ``AerPauliExpectation`` which uses the "
"snapshot instruction, when ``False``, default, then the regular "
"``PauliExpectation`` is returned."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/algorithms/04_vqe_advanced.ipynb:268
msgid ""
"The following example shows ``include_custom=True`` where the outcome "
"matches the statevector simulator. In fact it can be better/faster to do "
"this than use the statevector_simulator directly. This is because in the "
"latter case when the Hamiltonian is a sum of Paulis it must be converted "
"to matrix form, and this is avoided when using the snapshot instruction "
"done when include_custom is True."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/algorithms/04_vqe_advanced.ipynb:350
msgid ""
"In case you have doubts here is the aer_simulator again but "
"include_custom has been left to default to False. The optimization ended "
"abruptly, presumably due to the shot noise confusing the SLSQP optimizer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/algorithms/04_vqe_advanced.ipynb:443
msgid ""
"Changing the optimizer to SPSA, which is designed to work in noisy "
"environments, gets us a better result. Though the noise has affected the "
"outcome so it’s not as accurate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/algorithms/04_vqe_advanced.ipynb:524
msgid ""
"As mentioned above, an expectation object can be explicitly given (so the"
" internal ``ExpectationFactory`` and include_custom are never "
"used/needed. Below we create an ``AerPauliExpectation`` and pass this to "
"VQE. We can see the result matches that above where we set include_custom"
" to True and let VQE create its own expectation object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/algorithms/04_vqe_advanced.ipynb:606
msgid ""
"By default, the ``PauliExpectation`` object, that would have be chosen "
"when include_custom is False (or when using Aer aer_simulator, or a real "
"device) groups Paulis into commuting sets. This is efficient as it runs "
"less circuits to compute the expectation. However, if for some reason you"
" wanted to run a circuit for each Pauli then then grouping can be turned "
"off when constructing the PauliExpectation. You need to explicitly pass "
"in such an expectation instance to VQE to have it work this way though as"
" shown below."

"While you may be familiar with passing a QuantumInstancen created from a "
