"Qiskit provides a number of `Algorithms "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/qiskit.aqua.algorithms.html>`__ "
"and they are grouped by category according to the task they can perform. "
"For instance ``Minimum Eigensolvers`` to find the smallest eigen value of"
" an operator, for example ground state energy of a chemistry Hamiltonian "
"or a solution to an optimization problem when expressed as an Ising "
"Hamiltonian. There are ``Classifiers`` for machine learning "
"classification problems and ``Amplitude Estimators`` for value estimation"
" that can be used say in financial applications. The full set of "
"categories can be seen in the Algorithms documentation link above."

"Algorithms are configurable and often part of the configuration will be "

"Variational Quantum Eigensolver, it takes a trial wavefunction, in the "
"form of a ``QuantumCircuit`` and a classical optimizer among other "
"things. Such building blocks can be found as `Components "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/qiskit.aqua.components.html>`__ "

"parameterized circuit which can be varied, and ``SLSQP`` a classical "
"optimizer. These are created as separate instances and passed to VQE when"
" it is constructed. Trying, for example, a different classical optimizer,"
" or variational form is simply a case of creating an instance of the one "

"In order to run an algorithm we need to have backend, a simulator or real"

"Now a backend on its own does not have information on how you might want "
"to run the circuits etc. For example how many shots, do you want a noise "
"model, even options around transpiling the circuits. For this Qiskit Aqua"
" has a `QuantumInstance "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.aqua.QuantumInstance.html>`__"
" which is provided both the backend as well as various settings around "
"the circuit processing and execution so for instance:"

"So now we would be able to call the `run() "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.aqua.algorithms.VQE.html#qiskit.aqua.algorithms.VQE.run>`__"
" method, which is common to all algorithms and returns a result specific "
"for the algorithm. In this case since VQE is a MinimumEigensolver we "
"could use the `compute_mininum_eigenvalue() "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.aqua.algorithms.VQE.html#qiskit.aqua.algorithms.VQE.compute_minimum_eigenvalue>`__"
" method. The latter is the interface of choice for the application "
"modules, such as Chemistry and Optimization, in order that they can work "
"interchangeably with any algorithm within the specific category."

"Let’s put what we have learned from above together and create a complete "
"working example. VQE will find the minimum eigenvalue, i.e. minimum "
"energy value of a Hamiltonian operator and hence we need such an operator"
" for VQE to work with. Such an operator is given below. This was "
"originally created by the Chemistry application module as the Hamiltonian"
" for an H2 molecule at 0.735A interatomic distance. It’s a sum of Pauli "
"terms as below, but for now I am not going to say anything further about "
"it since the goal is to run the algorithm, but further information on "
"operators can be found in other tutorials."

"So let’s build a VQE instance passing the operator, and a backend using a"
" QuantumInstance, to the constructor. Now VQE does have setters so the "
"operator and backend can also be passed later. Setting them later can be "
"useful when creating an algorithm without this problem specific "
"information and then later using it, say with the chemistry application "
"module, which would create the operator for the specific chemistry "
