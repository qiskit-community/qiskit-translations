"Qiskit provides a number of `Algorithms "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/algorithms.html>`__ and they are"
" grouped by category according to the task they can perform. For instance"
" ``Minimum Eigensolvers`` to find the smallest eigen value of an "
"operator, for example ground state energy of a chemistry Hamiltonian or a"
" solution to an optimization problem when expressed as an Ising "
"Hamiltonian. There are ``Time Evolvers`` for the time evolution of "
"quantum systems and ``Amplitude Estimators`` for value estimation that "
"can be used say in financial applications. The full set of categories can"
" be seen in the Algorithms documentation link above."

"Algorithms are configurable and often part of the configuration will be "
"in the form of smaller building blocks, of which different instances of "
"the building block type can be given. For instance with ``VQE``, the "
"Variational Quantum Eigensolver, it takes a trial wavefunction, in the "
"form of a ``QuantumCircuit`` and a classical optimizer among other "
"things."

"Let's take a look at an example to construct a VQE instance. Here "
"``TwoLocal`` is the variational form (trial wavefunction), a "
"parameterized circuit which can be varied, and ``SLSQP`` a classical "
"optimizer. These are created as separate instances and passed to VQE when"
" it is constructed. Trying, for example, a different classical optimizer,"
" or variational form is simply a case of creating an instance of the one "
"you want and passing it into VQE."

"Let's put what we have learned from above together and create a complete "
"working example. VQE will find the minimum eigenvalue, i.e. minimum "
"energy value of a Hamiltonian operator and hence we need such an operator"
" for VQE to work with. Such an operator is given below. This was "
"originally created by the Nature application module as the Hamiltonian "
"for an H2 molecule at 0.735A interatomic distance. It's a sum of Pauli "
"terms as below, but for now I am not going to say anything further about "
