"Variational algorithms in Qiskit, like `VQE "

" and `QAOA "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.aqua.algorithms.QAOA.html>`__,"
" provide the option for a user to give a callback method that can be used"
" to monitor optimization progress as the algorithm runs and converges to "
"the minimum. The callback is invoked for each functional evaluation by "
"the optimizer and provides the current optimizer value, evaluation count,"
" current optimizer parameters etc. Note that, depending on the specific "
"optimizer this may not be each iteration (step) of the optimizer, so for "
"example if the optimizer is calling the cost function to compute a finite"
" difference based gradient this will be visible via the callback."

"Now from the callback data we stored we can plot the energy value at each"
" objective function call each optimizer makes. An optimizer using a "
"finite difference method for computing gradient has that characteristic "
"step like plot where for a number of evaluations it is computing the "
"value for close by points to establish a gradient (the close by points "
"having very similar values whose difference cannot be seen on the scale "
"of the graph here)."

"Finally since the above problem is still easily tractable classically we "

"solution as the energy converges with VQE towards the minimum value which"
" should be that exact classical solution."
