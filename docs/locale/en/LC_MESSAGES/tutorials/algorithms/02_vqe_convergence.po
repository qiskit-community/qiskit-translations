"Variational algorithms in Qiskit, like `VQE "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.algorithms.VQE.html>`__ "
"and `QAOA "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.algorithms.QAOA.html>`__, "
"provide the option for a user to give a callback method that can be used "
"to monitor optimization progress as the algorithm runs and converges to "
"the minimum. The callback is invoked for each functional evaluation by "
"the optimizer and provides the current optimizer value, evaluation count,"
" current optimizer parameters etc. Note that, depending on the specific "
"optimizer this may not be each iteration (step) of the optimizer, so for "
"example if the optimizer is calling the cost function to compute a finite"
" difference based gradient this will be visible via the callback."

"First we create a qubit operator for VQE. Here we will use the same "
"operator as used in the algorithms introduction, which was originally "
"computed by Qiskit Nature for an H2 molecule."

"We will show the callback usage below over a set of optimizers for "
"comparison. The minimum energy of the H2 Hamiltonian can be found quite "
"easily so we are able to set maxiters to a small value"

"Now from the callback data we stored we can plot the energy value at each"
" objective function call each optimizer makes. An optimizer using a "
"finite difference method for computing gradient has that characteristic "
"step like plot where for a number of evaluations it is computing the "
"value for close by points to establish a gradient (the close by points "
"having very similar values whose difference cannot be seen on the scale "
"of the graph here)."

"Finally since the above problem is still easily tractable classically we "
"can use NumPyMinimumEigensolver to compute a reference value for the "
"solution. We can now plot the difference from the resultant exact "
"solution as the energy converges with VQE towards the minimum value which"
" should be that exact classical solution."
