"Having established the reference ground energy, we next carry on with our"
" experiment. First we configure a VQE algorithm instance. The idea is "
"that we can set an termination condition such that the VQE instance "
"returns rather quickly with a rough estimation result."

"As previously indicated, the energy estimation result is rather rough–it "
"is far from being an acceptable final estimation figure. But, it is close"
" enough such that the accompanying variational form might be a reasonably"
" good approximation to the ground eigenstate, which means the "
"corresponding wave function can serve as the initial state for the IQPE "
"execution that follows. We next prepare such an initial state."

"As can be seen, the resultant ground state energy estimation, as produced"
