"This notebook demonstrates using the `Qiskit Aer "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/the_elements.html#aer>`__ "
"``aer_simulator`` to run a simulation with noise, based on a given noise "
"model. This can be useful to investigate behavior under different noise "
"conditions. Aer not only allows you to define your own custom noise "
"model, but also allows a noise model to be easily created based on the "
"properties of a real quantum device. The latter is what this notebook "
"will demonstrate since the goal is to show VQE with noise and not the "
"more complex task of how to build custom noise models."

"measurement noise mitigation applied."

"First we will run on the simulator without adding noise to see the "
"result. I have created the backend and QuantumInstance, which holds the "
"backend as well as various other run time configuration, which are "
"defaulted here, so it easy to compare when we get to the next section "
"where noise is added. There is no attempt to mitigate noise or anything "
"in this notebook so the latter setup and running of VQE is identical."

"First we need to get an actual device backend and from its "
"``configuration`` and ``properties`` we can setup a coupling map and a "
"noise model to match the device. While we could leave the simulator with "

"Note: We can also use this coupling map as the entanglement map for the "

"We produced a reference value using a classical algorithm and then "

"(no noise) there is so called shot-noise due to sampling - increasing the"
