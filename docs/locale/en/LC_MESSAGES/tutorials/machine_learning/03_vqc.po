"With the dataset ready we can setup the `VQC "

" algorithm to do a classification. We use the `ZZFeatureMap "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.ZZFeatureMap.html>`__"
" data encoding circuit from the Qiskit circuit library, like we did with "
"QSVM. But this is a variational algorithm so we need a variational form, "
"i.e. parameterized circuit, whose parameters can be varied by an "
"optimizer when computing VQC’s cost function. For this we choose "
"`TwoLocal "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.TwoLocal.html>`__"
" from the Qiskit circuit library. As the qasm_simulator has shot noise we"
" choose to use `SPSA "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.aqua.components.optimizers.SPSA.html>`__"
" which is designed to perform under noisy conditions."

"Now VQC, as well as QSVM, have ``train``, ``test`` and ``predict`` "
"methods. The ``run`` method, as used above, will call these in turn based"
" on whatever data was supplied to the algorithm. But the methods called "
"directly to say train a model and then do predict. Since the vqc instance"
" has already been trained, lets predict another set of sample datapoints "
"by directly calling ``predict``."
