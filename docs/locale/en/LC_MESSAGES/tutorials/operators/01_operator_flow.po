"The ``CircuitSampler`` traverses an Operator and converts any "
"``CircuitStateFns`` into approximations of the resulting state function "
"by a ``DictStateFn`` or ``VectorStateFn`` using a quantum backend. Note "
"that in order to approximate the value of the ``CircuitStateFn``, it must"
" 1) send the state function through a depolarizing channel, which will "
"destroy all phase information and 2) replace the sampled frequencies with"
" **square roots** of the frequency, rather than the raw probability of "
"sampling (which would be the equivalent of sampling the **square** of the"
" state function, per the Born rule.)"
