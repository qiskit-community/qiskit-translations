"Across many problems in finance, one starts with time series. Here, we "
"showcase how to generate pseudo-random time-series, download actual "
"stock-market time series from a number of common providers, and how to "
"compute time-series similarity measures."

"Once the data are loaded, you can run a variety of algorithms on those to"
" aggregate the data. Notably, you can compute the covariance matrix or a "
"variant, which would consider alternative time-series similarity measures"
" based on dynamic time warping (DTW). In DTW, changes that vary in speed,"
" e.g., one stock's price following another stock's price with a small "
"delay, can be accommodated."

"While the access to real-time data usually requires a payment, it is "
"possible to access historical (adjusted) closing prices via Wikipedia and"
" Quandl free of charge, following registration at: "
"https://www.quandl.com/?modal=register In the code below, one needs to "
"specify actual tickers of actual NASDAQ issues and the access token you "
"obtain from Quandl; by running the code below, you agree to the Quandl "
"terms and conditions, including a liability waiver. Notice that at least "
"two tickers are required for the computation of covariance and time-"
"series matrices, but hundreds of tickers may go beyond the fair usage "
"limits of Quandl."

"has an optional argument ``verify``, which can be ``None`` or a string or"
" a boolean. If it is ``None``, certify certificates will be used "
