"In this notebook, we discuss how a Quantum Machine Learning Algorithm, "
"namely a quantum Generative Adversarial Network (qGAN), can facilitate "
"the pricing of a European call option. More specifically, a qGAN can be "
"trained such that a quantum circuit models the spot price of an asset "
"underlying a European call option. The resulting model can then be "
"integrated into a Quantum Amplitude Estimation based algorithm to "
"evaluate the expected payoff - see `European Call Option Pricing "
"<03_european_call_option_pricing.ipynb>`__. For further details on "
"learning and loading random distributions by training a qGAN please refer"
" to Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Learning and Loading "

"The Black-Scholes model assumes that the spot price at maturity "
":math:`S_T` for a European call option is log-normally distributed. Thus,"
" we can train a qGAN on samples from a log-normal distribution and use "
"the result as an uncertainty model underlying the option. In the "
"following, we construct a quantum circuit that loads the uncertainty "
"model. The circuit output reads"
