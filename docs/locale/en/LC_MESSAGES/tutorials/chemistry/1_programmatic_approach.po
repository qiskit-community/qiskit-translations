"In this notebook, we decompose the computation of the ground state energy"
" of a molecule into 4 steps: 1. Define a molecule and get integrals from "
"a computational chemistry driver (PySCF in this case) 2. Construct a "
"Fermionic Hamiltonian and map it onto a qubit Hamiltonian 3. Instantiate "
"and initialize dynamically-loaded algorithmic components, such as the "
"quantum algorithm VQE, the optimizer and variational form it will use, "
"and the initial\\_state to initialize the variational form 4. Run the "
"algorithm on a quantum backend and retrieve the results"

"Here, we setup the **to-be-frozen** and **to-be-removed** orbitals to "

"Furthermore, we define the **mapping type** for the qubit Hamiltonian. "
"For the particular ``parity`` mapping, we can further reduce the problem "
