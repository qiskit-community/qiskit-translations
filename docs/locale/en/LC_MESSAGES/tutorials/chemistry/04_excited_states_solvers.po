"In this tutorial we are going to discuss the excited states calculation "
"interface of Qiskit Chemistry. The goal is to compute the excited states "
"of a molecular Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian can be electronic or "
"vibronic. To know more about the preparation of the Hamiltonian, check "
"out the Electronic structure and Vibronic structure tutorials."

"Let’s first start with a purely classical example: the NumPy eigensolver."
" This algorithm exactly diagonalizes the Hamiltonian. Although it scales "
"badly, it can be used on small systems to check the results of the "
"quantum algorithms. Here, we are only interested to look at eigenstates "
"with a given number of particle. To compute only those states a filter "
"function can be passed to the NumPy eigensolver. A default filter "
"function is already implemented in Qiskit and can be used in this way:"

"The excitation energies can also be accessed with the qEOM algorithm "
"[arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.12890 (2019)]. The EOM method finds the "
"excitation energies (differences in energy between the ground state and "
"all :math:`n`\\ th excited states) by solving the following pseudo-"
"eigenvalue problem."

"One can see from these results that one state is missing from the NumPy "
"results. The reason for this is because the spin is also used as a filter"

"states with incorrect number of particle (in this case the number of "
"particle is 2)."
