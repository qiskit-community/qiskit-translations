"To compute thermodynamic observables we begin with single point energy "
"calculation which calculates the wavefunction and charge density and "
"therefore the energy of a particular arrangement of nuclei. Here we "
"compute the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface of a hydrogen "
"molecule, as an example, which is simply the electronic energy as a "
"function of bond length."

"The Born-Oppeheimer approximation removes internuclear vibrations from "
"the molecular Hamiltonian and the energy computed from quantum mechanical"
" ground-state energy calculations using this approximation contain only "
"the electronic energy. Since even at absolute zero internuclear "
"vibrations still occur, a correction is required to obtain the true zero-"
"temperature energy of a molecule. This correction is called the zero-"
"point vibrational energy (ZPE), which is computed by summing the "
"contribution from internuclear vibrational modes. Therefore, the next "
"step in computing thermodynamic observables is determining the "
"vibrational energy levels. This can be done by constructing the Hessian "
"matrix based on computed single point energies close to the equilibrium "
"bond length. The eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix can then be used to "
"determine the vibrational energy levels and the zero-point vibrational "
"energy"
