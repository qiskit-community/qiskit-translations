"Qiskit strives to support as many platforms as possible, but due to "
"limitations in available testing resources and platform availability, not"
" all platforms can be supported. Platform support for Qiskit is broken "
"into 3 tiers with different levels of support for each tier. For "
"platforms outside these, Qiskit is probably still installable, but it's "
"not tested and you will have to build Qiskit (and likely Qiskit's "
"dependencies) from source."
