msgid ""
"Starting in this release, all unparametrized gates in the Qiskit standard"
" circuit library are now **singletons**. By default, these gates share a "
"single instance in memory, so once a gate of a specific type, let's say "
":class:`.XGate`, is instantiated, any subsequent instances of "
":class:`.XGate` will be a reference to the first one. This results in a "
"reduced memory usage and construction overhead when using multiple gates "
"of the same type in a circuit. To realize this feature, new base classes "
"have been introduced: :class:`.SingletonInstruction` and "
":class:`.SingletonGate`. See feature notes for more details."

"We have added a new **generic pass manager interface** that can be found "
"in the new :mod:`qiskit.passmanager` module. This is a generalization of "
"the pass manager that was used to build the Qiskit transpiler, and it "
"introduces a generic framework to enable users to create new pass "
"managers that use different intermediate representations (IRs). The "
"module includes a generic pass manager base class, flow controllers, and "
"the necessary infrastructure to manage the execution of pass manager "
"tasks. The new interface was used to rebuild the existing pass manager in"
" the :mod:`qiskit.transpiler` module, cleaning up technical debt in the "
"code, and improving usability and performance. See feature and upgrade "
"notes for more details."

"0.45.0 allows users to better interact with the **layout permutations** "
