"**A:** Please cite Qiskit by using the included `BibTeX file "
"<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qiskit/qiskit/master/Qiskit.bib>`__."

"**Q: Why do I receive the error message** ``AttributeError: "
"QuantumCircuit object has no attribute save_state`` **when using "
"``save_*``method on a circuit?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:17
msgid ""
"**A:** The ``save_*`` instructions are part of Qiskit Aer project, a high"
" performance simulator for quantum circuits. These instructions do not "
"exist outside of Qiskit Aer and are added dynamically to the "
":class:`~.QuantumCircuit` class by Qiskit Aer on import. If you would "
"like to use these instructions you must first ensure that you have "
"imported ``qiskit_aer`` in your program before trying to call these "
"methods. You can refer to :mod:`qiskit_aer.library` for the details of "
"these custom instructions included with Qiskit Aer."

"**Q: Why do my results from real devices differ from my results from the "
"simulator?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:28
msgid ""
"**A:** The simulator runs jobs as though is was in an ideal environment; "
"one without noise or decoherence. However, when jobs are run on the real "
"devices there is noise from the environment and decoherence, which causes"
" the qubits to behave differently than what is intended."

"**Q: Why do I receive the error message,** ``No Module 'qiskit'`` **when "
"using Jupyter Notebook?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:37
msgid ""
"**A:** If you used ``pip install qiskit`` and set up your virtual "
"environment in Anaconda, then you may experience this error when you run "
"a tutorial in Jupyter Notebook. If you have not installed Qiskit or set "
"up your virtual environment, you can follow the :ref:`installation` "
"steps."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:42
msgid ""
"The error is caused when trying to import the Qiskit package in an "
"environment where Qiskit is not installed. If you launched Jupyter "
"Notebook from the Anaconda-Navigator, it is possible that Jupyter "
"Notebook is running in the base (root) environment, instead of in your "
"virtual environment. Choose a virtual environment in the Anaconda-"
"Navigator from the **Applications on** dropdown menu. In this menu, you "
"can see all of the virtual environments within Anaconda, and you can "
"select the environment where you have Qiskit installed to launch Jupyter "
"Notebook."

msgid "**Q: Why am I getting a compilation error while installing ``qiskit``?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:56
msgid ""
"**A:** Qiskit depends on a number of other open source Python packages, "
"which are automatically installed when doing ``pip install qiskit``. "
"Depending on your system's platform and Python version, is it possible "
"that a particular package does not provide pre-built binaries for your "
"system. You can refer to :ref:`platform_support` for a list of platforms "
"supported by Qiskit, some of which may need an extra compiler. In cases "
"where there are no precompiled binaries available ``pip`` will attempt to"
" compile the package from source, which in turn might require some extra "
"dependencies that need to be installed manually."

"please check the documentation of the package that failed to install (in "
