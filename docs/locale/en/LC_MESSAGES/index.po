"The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it "
"easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level"
" or area of interest; Qiskit allows one to easily design experiments and "
"run them on classical simulators and/or real quantum computers.  Qiskit "
"is already in use around the world by beginners, hobbyists, educators, "
"researchers, and commercial companies."
