"The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it "
"easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level"
" or area of interest; Qiskit allows one to easily design experiments and "
"applications and run them on real quantum computers and/or classical "
"simulators.  Qiskit is already in use around the world by beginners, "
"hobbyists, educators, researchers, and commercial companies."
