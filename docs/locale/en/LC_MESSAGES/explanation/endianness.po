"While most physics textbooks represent an :math:`n`-qubit system as the "
"tensor product :math:`Q_0\\otimes Q_1 \\otimes ... \\otimes Q_{n-1}`, "
"where :math:`Q_j` is the :math:`j^{\\mathrm{th}}` qubit, Qiskit uses the "
"inverse order, that is, :math:`Q_{n-1}\\otimes ... \\otimes Q_1 \\otimes "
"Q_{0}`. As explained in `this video "
"<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiqHj3_Avps>`_ from `Qiskit's YouTube "
"channel <https://www.youtube.com/@qiskit>`_, this is done to follow the "
"convention in classical computing, in which the :math:`n^{\\mathrm{th}}` "
"bit or most significant bit (MSB) is placed on the left (with index 0) "
"while the least significant bit (LSB) is placed on the right (index "
":math:`n-1`). This ordering convention is called little-endian while the "
"one from the physics textbooks is called big-endian."

"This means that if we have, for example, a 3-qubit system with qubit 0 in"
" state :math:`|1\\rangle` and qubits 1 and 2 in state :math:`|0\\rangle`,"
" Qiskit would represent this state as :math:`|001\\rangle` while most "
"physics textbooks would represent this state as :math:`|100\\rangle`."

"This different order can also make the circuit corresponding to an "
"algorithm from a textbook a bit more complicated to visualize. "
"Fortunately, Qiskit provides a way to represent a "
":class:`~.QuantumCircuit` with the most significant qubits on top, just "
"like in the textbooks. This can be done by setting the ``reverse_bits`` "
"argument of the :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.draw` method to ``True``."
