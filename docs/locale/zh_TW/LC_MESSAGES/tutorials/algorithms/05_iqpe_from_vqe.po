msgid "Having established the reference ground energy, we next carry on with our experiment. First we configure a VQE algorithm instance. The idea is that we can set an termination condition such that the VQE instance returns rather quickly with a rough estimation result."

#: ../../tutorials/algorithms/05_iqpe_from_vqe.ipynb:163
msgid "As previously indicated, the energy estimation result is rather rough–it is far from being an acceptable final estimation figure. But, it is close enough such that the accompanying variational form might be a reasonably good approximation to the ground eigenstate, which means the corresponding wave function can serve as the initial state for the IQPE execution that follows. We next prepare such an initial state."

msgid "As can be seen, the resultant ground state energy estimation, as produced by IQPE, is much more accurate that the intermediate result produced by VQE."
