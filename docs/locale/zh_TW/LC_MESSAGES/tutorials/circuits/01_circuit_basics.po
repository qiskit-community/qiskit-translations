msgid "Here, we provide an overview of working with Qiskit. Qiskit provides the basic building blocks necessary to program quantum computers. The fundamental unit of Qiskit is the `quantum circuit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit>`__. A basic workflow using Qiskit consists of two stages: **Build** and **Run**. **Build** allows you to make different quantum circuits that represent the problem you are solving, and **Run** that allows you to run them on different backends. After the jobs have been run, the data is collected and postprocessed depending on the desired output."

Suppose there are :math:`n` qubits, and qubit :math:`j` is labeled as :math:`Q_{j}`. Qiskit uses an ordering in which the :math:`n^{\\mathrm{th}}` qubit is on the left side of the tensor product, so that the basis vectors are labeled as :math:`Q_{n-1}\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes Q_1\\otimes Q_0`."
