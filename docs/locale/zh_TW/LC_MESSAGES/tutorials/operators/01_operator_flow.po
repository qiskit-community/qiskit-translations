For example, if we want to measure the expectation value of an Operator ``o`` expressed as a sum of Paulis with respect to some state function, but can only access diagonal measurements on quantum hardware, we can create an observable ``~StateFn(o)`` and use a ``PauliExpectation`` to convert it to a diagonal measurement and circuit pre-rotations to append to the state."
