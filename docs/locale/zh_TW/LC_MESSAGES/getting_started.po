#: ../../getting_started.rst:113
msgid "When installing the elements and components from source, by default their ``development`` version (which corresponds to the ``master`` git branch) will be used, as opposed to the ``stable`` version (which contains the same codebase as the published ``pip`` packages).

msgid "after you run pip and that will rebuild the binary in release mode. If you are working on Rust code in Qiskit you will need to rebuild the extension code every time you make a local change. ``pip install -e .`` will only build the Rust extension when it's called, so any local changes you make to the Rust code after running pip will not be reflected in the installed package unless you rebuild the extension.
