msgid "The :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance` is a utility class that allows the joint configuration of the circuit transpilation and execution steps, and provides functions at a higher level of abstraction for a more convenient integration with algorithms. These include measurement error mitigation, splitting/combining execution to conform to job limits, and ensuring reliable execution of circuits with additional job management tools."

msgid "The :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance` is being deprecated for several reasons: On one hand, the functionality of :meth:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance.execute` has now been delegated to the different implementations of the :mod:`~qiskit.primitives` base classes. On the other hand, with the direct implementation of transpilation at the primitives level, the algorithms no longer need to manage that aspect of execution, and thus :meth:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance.transpile` is no longer required by the workflow. If desired, custom transpilation routines can still be performed at the user level through the :mod:`~qiskit.transpiler` module (see table below)."
