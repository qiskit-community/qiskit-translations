For example, if you have a function ``foo()`` which is going to be replaced with ``bar()`` you can't deprecate the ``foo()`` function in the same release that introduces ``bar()``. The ``bar()`` function needs to be available in a release prior to the deprecation of ``foo()``. This is necessary to enable downstream consumers of Qiskit that maintain their own libraries to write code that works with > 1 release at a time, which is important for the entire ecosystem. If you would like to indicate that a deprecation will be coming in a future release you can use the ``PendingDeprecationWarning``  warning to signal this. But, the deprecation period only begins after a ``DeprecationWarning`` is being emitted."

msgid "3. An obsolescence date for the feature will be set. The feature must remain intact and working (although with the proper warning being emitted) in all releases pushed until after that obsolescence date. At the very minimum, the feature (or API, or configuration option) should be marked as deprecated (and continue to be supported) for at least three months of linear time from the release date of the first release to include the deprecation warning. For example, if a feature were deprecated in the 0.9.0 release of Terra, which was released on August 22, 2019, then that feature should still appear in all releases until at least November 22, 2019."
msgstr ""

#: ../../contributing_to_qiskit.rst:299
msgid "Note that this delay is a minimum. For significant features, it is recommended that the deprecated feature appears for at least double that time. Also, per the stable branch policy, deprecation removals can only occur during minor version releases; they are not appropriate for backporting."

For example, if a feature is deprecated in 0.20.0 which is released on January 20, 2022 and the next minor version release 0.21.0 is released on June 16, 2022 the deprecated feature can't be removed until the 0.22.0 release, even though 0.21.0 was more than three months after the 0.20.0 release. This is important because the point of the deprecation warnings are to inform users that a potentially breaking API change is coming and to give them a chance to adapt their code. However, many users skip versions (especially if there are a large numbers of changes in each release) and don't upgrade to every release, so might miss the warning if it's only present for a single minor version release."

#: ../../contributing_to_qiskit.rst:333
msgid "One thing to note here is the ``stack_level`` kwarg on the warn() call. This argument is used to specify which level in the call stack will be used as the line initiating the warning. Typically, ``stack_level`` should be set to 2, as this will show the line calling the context where the warning was raised. In the above example, it would be the caller of ``foo()``. If you did not set this, the warning would show that it was caused by the line in the foo() function, which is not helpful for users trying to determine the origin of a deprecated call. However, this value may be adjusted, depending on the call stack and where ``warn()`` gets called from. For example, if the warning is always raised by a private method that only has one caller, ``stack_level=3`` might be appropriate."
msgstr "這裡要注意的是 ` ` stack_level`` kwarg on the warn() 呼叫。 這個引數用以指定呼叫堆疊中的哪個級別將作為起始警告的行。 一般而言， ``stack_level`` 應該設為 2，因為這會顯示呼叫警告的字行。 在上述範例中，它將是 ``foo()`` 的呼叫者，若您尚未設定這個，那麼警告會顯示它是由 foo() 函數中的字行造成的，這對嘗試判定已淘汰呼叫來源的使用者而言是沒有幫助的。 不過，此值可能會根據呼叫堆疊以及在其中呼叫 ``warn()`` 取得的位置來調整。 例如：如果警告一律由只具有一個呼叫端的私有方法產生， ``` stack_level=3`` 可能是適當的。"

If the module specified is a directory/namespace, the docstring should be specified in the ``__init__.py`` file for that directory. This module-level docstring contains more details about the module being documented. The normal structure to this docstring is to outline all the classes and functions of the public API that are contained in that module. This is typically done using the `autosummary directive <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autosummary.html>`__ (or `autodoc directives <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`__ directly if the module is simple, such as in the case of ``qiskit.execute``). The autosummary directive is used to autodoc a list of different Python elements (classes, functions, etc.) directly without having to manually call out the autodoc directives for each one. The module-level docstring is where to provide a high-level overview of what functionality the module provides. This is normally done by grouping the different components of the public API together into multiple subsections."
msgstr "此 docstring 位於 rst 檔案 ``automobule` 指引中指定之模組的模組層次。 如果指定的模組是目錄 / 命名空間，則應在該目錄的 ``__init__.py`` 檔案中指定 docstring 。 此模組層次的 docstring 包含所記載模組的更多詳細資料。 此 docstring 的一般結構是概述包含在該模組中的公用 API 中所有類別和函數。 這通常是使用 ` 自動摘要指引 <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autosummary.html>`__ (或 `autodoc 指引 ' ，如果模組很簡單，例如 ```qiskit.execute``)，則會直接執行 <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`__ 。 自動摘要指引會直接用於自動提交不同 Python 元素(類別、函數等)的清單，而不必手動呼叫每一個 Python 元素的自動文件指引。 module-level docstring 提供模組所提供之功能的進階概觀。 這通常是將公用 API 的不同元件組合成多個子區段來完成。"

For example, if the meta-package version is currently 0.13.0, then that will copy the documentation from Terra's 0.10.0 release. When the meta-package's requirements are bumped, then it will start pulling documentation from the new version.
