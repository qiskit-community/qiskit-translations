msgid "In this notebook, we discuss how a Quantum Machine Learning Algorithm, namely a quantum Generative Adversarial Network (qGAN), can facilitate the pricing of a European call option. More specifically, a qGAN can be trained such that a quantum circuit models the spot price of an asset underlying a European call option. The resulting model can then be integrated into a Quantum Amplitude Estimation based algorithm to evaluate the expected payoff - see `European Call Option Pricing <../simulation/european_call_option_pricing.ipynb>`__. For further details on learning and loading random distributions by training a qGAN please refer to Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Learning and Loading Random Distributions. Zoufal, Lucchi, Woerner. 2019."

msgid "The Black-Scholes model assumes that the spot price at maturity :math:`S_T` for a European call option is log-normally distributed. Thus, we can train a qGAN on samples from a log-normal distribution and use the result as an uncertainty model underlying the option. A notebook that explains the implementation of a qGAN to learn and load a random distribution is presented in `qGANs for Loading Random Distributions <../../aqua/machine_learning/qgans_for_loading_random_distributions.ipynb>`__. In the following, we construct a quantum circuit that loads the uncertainty model. The circuit output reads"
