msgid "In this tutorial we are going to discuss the excited states calculation interface of Qiskit Chemistry. The goal is to compute the excited states of a molecular Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian can be electronic or vibronic. To know more about the preparation of the Hamiltonian, check out the Electronic structure and Vibronic structure tutorials."

msgid "Let’s first start with a purely classical example: the NumPy eigensolver. This algorithm exactly diagonalizes the Hamiltonian. Although it scales badely, it can be used on small systems to check the results of the quantum algorithms. Here, we are only interested to look at eigenstates with a given number of particle. To compute only those states a filter function can be passed to the NumPy eigensolver. A default filter function is already implemented in Qiskit and can be used in this way:"

The EOM method finds the excitation energies (differences in energy between the ground state and all :math:`n`\\ th excited states) by solving the following pseudo-eigenvalue problem."
