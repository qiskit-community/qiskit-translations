msgid "We’ve created a random circuit with just 60 gates, that acts on 40 qubits. But, because of the number of qubits, if we wanted to run this with say the statevector simulator then I hope you have access to terabytes of RAM!"

msgid "The Extended Stabilizer method is made up of two parts. The first is a method of decomposing quantum circuits into *stabilizer circuits*, a special class of circuit that can be efficiently simulated classically. The second is then a way of combining these circuits to perform measurements."

msgid "One thing that’s important to note is these decompositions are approximate. This means that the results aren’t exactly the same as with the State Vector simulator."

msgid "You can control this approximation error using the ``extended_stabilizer_approximation_error`` in Qiskit Aer. The default error is 0.05. The smaller the error, the more precise the results, but also the longer your simulation will take and the more memory it will require."

msgid "There are several other options you can tweak to control how the extended stabilizer method performs. What these options are and their explanation can all be found in the Qiskit Aer documentation. However, I want to highlight two important ones that can help to optimize your simulations."

#: ../../tutorials/simulators/6_extended_stabilizer_tutorial.ipynb:406
msgid "To perform measurements, the extended stabilizer method uses a Markov chain method to sample outcomes at random. This Markov chain has to be run for some time we call the ‘mixing time’ before it will start sampling, and has to be re-mixed for every circuit shot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/simulators/6_extended_stabilizer_tutorial.ipynb:408
msgid "If you expect your circuit output to be concentrated on just a few output states, then you can likely optimize your simulations by reducing the ``extended_stabilizer_mixing_time`` option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/simulators/6_extended_stabilizer_tutorial.ipynb:461
msgid "Similarly, if your circuit has some non-zero probability on all amplitudes (e.g. if it’s a random circuit), then you can avoid this expensive re-mixing step to take multiple shots from the output at once. This can be enabled by setting ``extended_stabilizer_measure_sampling=True``."

msgid "If you have smaller circuits with lots of non-Clifford gates, then the statevector method will likely perform better than the extended stabilizer. If however you want to look at circuits on many qubits, without needing access to high performance computation, then give this method a try!"
