msgid "Qiskit Pulse programs give you more control than ``QuantumCircuit``. At this level, you can specify the exact time dynamics of the input signals across all input channels. Most quantum algorithm can be described with circuits alone using gate operations – typically, it’s when you want to apply error mitigation techniques or characterize a time-dependent quality of a quantum system that pulse-level control becomes useful."

msgid "Perhaps the most central instruction for building schedules is the ``Waveform``. It is a pulse signal specified as an array of time-ordered complex amplitudes, or *samples*. Each sample is played for one cycle, a timestep ``dt``, determined by the backend. If we want to know the real-time dynamics of our program, we need to know the value of ``dt``. For now, let’s focus on how to build the instruction."

msgid "There are multiple ways to build pulses, which you can learn about on later pages. This time, we’ve simply passed the exact amplitudes of the pulse envelope we want to play as an array. The array above is a Gaussian function evaluated at 64 points, with an amplitude of 1 and a standard deviation of 8. The (zero-indexed) :math:`i^{th}` sample will play from time ``i*dt`` up to ``(i + 1)*dt``, modulated by the qubit frequency. Think of this like an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), playing the samples you give to the ``Waveform``, mixed with a continuous sine wave generator outputting a tone at the qubit frequency."

msgid "The values above happen to be real, but they can also be complex. The amplitude norm of any pulse signal is arbitrarily limited to 1. Each backend system may also impose further constraints – for instance, a minimum pulse size of 64.

When we build circuits, we specify which qubit a gate operation should be applied to. In Pulse, every qubit has multiple *channels*."
msgstr "다음으로, 방금 만든 펄스 신호를 실행하기 위한 명령어를 추가 한다. 이는 펄스가 재생되어야 하는 *time*을 지정하는 것뿐만 아니라, 펄스가 *where*에서 재생되어야 하는지를 지정하는 것을 의미한다. 우리는 회로를 만들 때 어떤 큐빗에 게이트를 적용해야 하는지를 지정한다. 펄스에서, 모든 큐비트는 다수의 *channels*들을 갖는다."

msgid "There is a new pulse on ``MeasureChannel`` ``m0``, a shorthand name for ``MeasureChannel(0)``. This channel stimulates readout on qubit 0. Likewise, ``a0`` is shorthand for ``AcquireChannel(0)``.
