msgid "The brute-force method is as follows. Basically, we exhaustively try all the binary assignments. In each binary assignment, the entry of a vertex is either 0 (meaning the vertex is in the first partition) or 1 (meaning the vertex is in the second partition). We print the binary assignment that satisfies the definition of the graph partition and corresponds to the minimal number of crossing edges."

msgid "The graph partition problem can be converted to an Ising Hamiltonian. Qiskit has different capabilities in the Optimization module to do this. Here, since the goal is to show QAOA, the module is used without further explanation to create the operator. The paper `Ising formulations of many NP problems <https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5843>`__ may be of interest if you would like to understand the technique further."
