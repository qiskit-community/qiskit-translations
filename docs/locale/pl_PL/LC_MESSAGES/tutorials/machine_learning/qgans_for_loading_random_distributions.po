msgid "The qGAN consists of a quantum generator :math:`G_{\\theta}`, a variational quantum circuit, and a classical discriminator :math:`D_{\\phi}`, a neural network. To implement the quantum generator, we choose a depth-\\ :math:`1` variational form that implements :math:`R_Y` rotations and :math:`CZ` gates which takes a uniform distribution as an input state. Notably, for :math:`k>1` the generator's parameters must be chosen carefully. For example, the circuit depth should be :math:`>1` because higher circuit depths enable the representation of more complex structures. The classical discriminator is given by a :math:`3`-layer neural network that applies linear transformations, leaky ReLU functions in the hidden layers and a sigmoid function in the output layer. Notably, the neural network is implemented with PyTorch. Please refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for PyTorch installation instructions. Here, both networks are updated with the ADAM optimization algorithm."
