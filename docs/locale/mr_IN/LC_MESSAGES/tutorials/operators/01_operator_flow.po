msgid "The ``CircuitSampler`` traverses an Operator and converts any ``CircuitStateFn``\\ s into approximations of the resulting state function by a ``DictStateFn`` or ``VectorStateFn`` using a quantum backend. Note that in order to approximate the value of the ``CircuitStateFn``, it must 1) send the state function through a depolarizing channel, which will destroy all phase information and 2) replace the sampled frequencies with **square roots** of the frequency, rather than the raw probability of sampling (which would be the equivalent of sampling the **square** of the state function, per the Born rule)."
