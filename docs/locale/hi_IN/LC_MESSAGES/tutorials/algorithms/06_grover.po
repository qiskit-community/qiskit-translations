msgid "Grover’s algorithm is one of the most famous quantum algorithms introduced by Lov Grover in 1996 [1]. It has initially been proposed for unstructured search problems, i.e. for finding a marked element in a unstructured database. However, Grover’s algorithm is now a subroutine to several other algorithms, such as Grover Adaptive Search [2]. For the details of Grover’s algorithm, please see `Grover’s Algorithm <https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html>`__ in the Qiskit textbook."
