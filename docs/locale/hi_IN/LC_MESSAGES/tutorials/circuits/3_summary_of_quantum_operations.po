msgid "U can be implemented as a “quantum multiplexor” gate, since it is a block diagonal matrix. In the quantum multiplexor formalism, a block diagonal matrix of size :math:`2^n \\times 2^n`, and consisting of :math:`2^s` blocks, is equivalent to a multiplexor with :math:`s` select qubits and :math:`n-s` data qubits. Depending on the state of the select qubits, the corresponding blocks are applied to the data qubits. A multiplexor of this kind can be implemented after recursive decomposition to primitive gates of cx, rz and ry."
