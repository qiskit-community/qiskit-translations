msgid "Within the physics community, the qubits of a multi-qubit systems are typically ordered with the first qubit on the left-most side of the tensor product and the last qubit on the right-most side. For instance, if the first qubit is in state :math:`\\left|0\\right\\rangle` and second is in state :math:`\\left|1\\right\\rangle`, their joint state would be :math:`\\left|01\\right\\rangle`. Qiskit uses a slightly different ordering of the qubits, in which the qubits are represented from the most significant bit (MSB) on the left to the least significant bit (LSB) on the right (big-endian). This is similar to bitstring representation on classical computers, and enables easy conversion from bitstrings to integers after measurements are performed. For the example just given, the joint state would be represented as :math:`\\left|10\\right\\rangle`. Importantly, *this change in the representation of multi-qubit states affects the way multi-qubit gates are represented in Qiskit*, as discussed below."
