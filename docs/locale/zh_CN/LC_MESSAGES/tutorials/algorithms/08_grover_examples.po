It should be quite easy to figure out the satisfying solution by examining its parts: ``w ^ x`` calls for ``w`` and ``x`` taking different values; ``~(y ^ z)`` requires ``y`` and ``z`` be the same; ``x & y & z`` dictates all three to be ``True``. Putting these together, we get the satisfying solution ``(w, x, y, z) = (False, True, True, True)``, which our ``Grover``\\ ’s result agrees with."
