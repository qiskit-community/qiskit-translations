msgid "This shows how to generate the circuits. The list of qubits specifies for which qubits to generate characterization circuits; these circuits will run in parallel. The discrete unit of time is the identity gate (``iden``) and so the user must specify the time of each identity gate if they would like the characterization parameters returned in units of time. This should be available from the backend."
