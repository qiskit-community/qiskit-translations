If you are working on Rust code in Qiskit you will need to rebuild the extension code every time you make a local change. ``pip install -e .`` will only build the Rust extension when it's called, so any local changes you make to the Rust code after running pip will not be reflected in the installed package unless you rebuild the extension.

#: ../../getting_started.rst:177
msgid "Qiskit strives to support as many platforms as possible, but due to limitations in available testing resources and platform availability, not all platforms can be supported. Platform support for Qiskit is broken into 3 tiers with different levels of support for each tier. For platforms outside these, Qiskit is probably still installable, but it's not tested and you will have to build Qiskit (and likely Qiskit's dependencies) from source."
msgstr "Qiskit 力求支持尽可能多的平台，但由于可用的测试资源及平台可用性的限制，并非所有平台都可以支持。 对 Qiskit 的平台支持分为 3 层，每层的支持级别各有不同。 对于这些平台之外的平台， Qiskit 可能仍可安装，但未经过测试，您将不得不从源代码构建 Qiskit (和可能的 Qiskit 相关依赖) 。"

msgstr "第 1 层支持的平台在开发过程的上游经过完全的测试，以确保任何提议的改变都能正常运行。 预编译的二进制文件被构建、测试和发布到 PyPI 作为发布过程的一部分。 由于所有依赖关系都在这些平台上可用，因此这些平台只需要一个可以正常运行的 Python 环境就可以安装。"
