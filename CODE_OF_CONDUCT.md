# Translate Responsibly
In addition to the IBM Quantum Community [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), the Qiskit Localization Project values the following standards which are applicable in the context of community translation efforts.

### Examples of translating responsibly:
- Being mindful of the context when translating (having the original source material available to be referenced frequently is highly recommended).
- Focusing on the quality of translations above quantity
- Engaging in collaboration and valuing opinions and suggestions from other translators
- Using tools such as the [Sphinx editor](https://livesphinx.herokuapp.com/) and [Staging site](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-translations/) to check and correct syntax errors before accepting translations

### Examples of  irresponsible acts or translating may include:
- Copy pasting other’s translation work
- Blindly accepting translations without careful quality check
- Abuse of machine translation with no regard to its translation quality
- Other conduct which could be reasonably be considered inappropriate
