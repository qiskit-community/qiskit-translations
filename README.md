# Qiskit Documentation Translations

First of all, **thank** you for showing your interest in translating Qiskit Documentation! This helps make the documentations more accessible and available to our global community. 

Qiskit documentation is translated (localized) using Crowdin, a software and web localization platform that allows organizations to coordinate translation projects and collaborate with communities to translate materials. Crowdin allows our community of translators to amplify their impact by automatically reusing the work invested translating one sentence to translate other, similar sentences. Crowdin also makes translations resilient to many types of changes to the original material, such as moving sentences around, even across files.

If you are interested in contributing to translations, please follow the instructions below. If you find any errors or glitches in the original documentation, please feel free to open an issue as well.

### For sighing up to participate in translations:

      - Each contributor has to create their own PR and sign the CLA.

### For adding a new language to translate
The Qiskit Localization Project currently suppports: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Spanish- Mexico, and Turkish.

As mentioned in the blog post, `Qiskit in my language is Qiskit <https://medium.com/qiskit/qiskit-in-my-language-is-qiskit-73d4626a99d3>`__ we want to make sure that translated languages have enough community support to ensure quality and consistency.
If you want to add a new language and become a translation lead, you can open a `GitHub issue <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-translations/issues/new/choose>`__ to start a discussion with the Qiskit team and recruit translation project members.

The general criteria for adding a new language is outlined below:
#. A minimum of three contributors are necessary for any new languages to be added to receive official support from the administrators of the localization project.
#. In addition to translators, we will need dedicated proof-readers to review the translations and approve accuracy of content in that language to ensure the translations to be released in that language.
#. Among the group of contributors, a translation lead must be identified to serve as a liaison with the administrators of the localization project. The lead must contact: Yuri Kobayashi (yurik@jp.ibm.com) by email for the language to be officially listed under this project. 

For further details, please feel free to contact yurik@jp.ibm.com for any questions regarding adding new langauges to the Qiskit Localization project. Thank you.
