msgid "The quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm is an important subroutine in quantum computation. It serves as a central building block of many quantum algorithms including the Shor’s factoring algorithm and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations (HHL algorithm). In this tutorial, you will build a parameterized version of QPE circuit and run it using the Sampler primitive, which makes running parameterized circuits very easy."

msgid "The QPE algorithm [1][2] estimates the value of theta, where a unitary operator :math:`U` has an eigenvector :math:`|\\psi \\rangle` with eigenvalue :math:`e^{2\\pi i \\theta}`. To find the estimation, we assume we have black boxes (sometimes called *oracles*), that can prepare the state :math:`|\\psi \\rangle` and run a controlled-:math:`U^{2^j}` operation."

In this tutorial, you will prepare a series of QPE circuits containing different black boxes corresponding to different phases. You will then run these circuits using the `Sampler primitive <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Sampler.html>`__ and analyze the results. As you will see, the Sampler primitive makes running parameterized circuits very easy. Instead of creating a series of QPE circuits, you only need to create *one* QPE circuit with a parameter specifying the phase the black boxes generate and a series of phase values for the parameter."
