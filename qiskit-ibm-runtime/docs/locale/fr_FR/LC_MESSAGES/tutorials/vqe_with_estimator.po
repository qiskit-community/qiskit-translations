msgid "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is an optimization routine for finding the ground state energy (the lowest eigenvalue) of a `Hamiltonian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)>`__ and is a considered to be a viable candidate for near-term hardware. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Qiskit Runtime to submit variational jobs using the estimator primitive. Specifically, you will calculate the ground state energy of the :math:`H_2` molecule."

msgid "This tutorial uses Qiskit Nature to generate and handle molecular Hamiltonians. If you haven’t already, you can install Qiskit Nature (and the PySCF addon) using the commands shown below. For more information about Qiskit Nature, see the `Getting started guide <https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/getting_started.html>`__."

msgid "Next, we will generate the Hamiltonians that we want to find the ground state energy of. The first step is to use the ``PySCFDriver`` to convert a string representing our molecule to an ``ElectronicStructureProblem``. The next step is to use the ``ParityMapper`` to convert this problem into a qubit Hamiltonian that can run on a quantum computer."

msgid "Finally, the code cell below plots the intermediate results from the optimization process. The optimization algorithm tweaks the parameters to gradually home in on values that produce lower energies. Provided the algorithm does not get caught in a local minima, this graph will plateau at the electronic ground state energy of the molecule."
