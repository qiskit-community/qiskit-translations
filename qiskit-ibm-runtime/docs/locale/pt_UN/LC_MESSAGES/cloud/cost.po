msgid "The time your job takes (and therefore, its cost) depends on how many iterations you make in a session and how many shots are run in each iteration. Therefore, you can manage your cost by running only as many iterations and shots as you need."

msgid "Additionally, an instance administrator can limit how much is spent. To set cost limits, navigate to the `IBM Cloud Instances page <https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances>`__, then click the instance and set the **Cost limit**. The cost limit refers to the total cost of all jobs run with this instance since it was created, and it will always be greater than or equal to the Total cost. After the instance reaches the specified number of total seconds, no further jobs can be run and no more cost is incurred."

#: ../../cloud/cost.rst:21
msgid "The cost limit is always specified in US dollars (USD), then converted to runtime seconds.  However, for monthly billing purposes, you are charged in your local currency, specified on your IBM Cloud account. Because currency exchange rates can fluctuate, the cost for `X` runtime seconds might be different when initially calculated in USD than when you're actually charged in your local currency.  As a result, if your local currency is not USD, the total amount charged for the number of seconds specified in this field could vary from the dollar amount you specify."
