msgid "Error mitigation techniques allow users to mitigate circuit errors by modeling the device noise at the time of execution. This typically results in quantum pre-processing overhead related to model training and classical post-processing overhead to mitigate errors in the raw results by using the generated model."

#: ../../how_to/error-mitigation.rst:8
msgid "The resilience level specifies how much resilience to build against errors. Higher levels generate more accurate results, at the expense of longer processing times. Resilience levels can be used to configure the cost/accuracy trade-off when applying error mitigation to your primitive query. Error mitigation reduces errors (bias) in results by processing the outputs from a collection, or ensemble, of related circuits. The degree of error reduction depends on the method applied. The resilience level abstracts the detailed choice of error mitigation method to allow users to reason about the cost/accuracy trade that is appropriate to their application."

msgid "Level 1 applies error mitigation methods that particularly address readout errors. In the Estimator, we apply a model-free technique known as Twirled Readout Error eXtinction (TREX). It reduces measurement error by diagonalizing the noise channel associated with measurement by randomly flipping qubits via X gates immediately prior to measurement, and flipping the corresponding measured bit if an X gate was applied. A rescaling term from the diagonal noise channel is learned by benchmarking random circuits initialized in the zero state. This allows the service to remove bias from expectation values that result from readout noise. This approach is described further in `Model-free readout-error mitigation for quantum expectation values <https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09738>`__."

This approach tends to reduce errors in expectation values, but is not guaranteed to produce an unbiased result."

msgstr ""

#: ../../how_to/error-mitigation.rst:87
msgid "Level 3 enables the Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) method. This approach mitigates error by learning and inverting a sparse noise model that is able to capture correlated noise. PEC returns an unbiased estimate of an expectation value so long as learned noise model faithfully represents the actual noise model at the time of mitigation.  In practice, the experimental procedure for learning the noise model has ambiguities due to certain error terms that cannot be independently distinguished. These are resolved by a symmetry assumption, which depending on the true underlying noise may lead a biased estimate of the mitigated expectation values due to using an imperfect noise model."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how_to/error-mitigation.rst:89
msgid "The Qiskit Runtime primitive implementation of PEC specifically addresses noise in self-inverse two-qubit gates, so it first *stratifies* each input circuit into an alternating sequence of simultaneous 1-qubit gates followed by a layer of simultaneous 2-qubit gates. Then it learns the noise model associated with each unique 2-qubit gate layer."

msgstr ""

#: ../../how_to/error-mitigation.rst:98
msgid "PEC uses a quasi-probability method to mimic the effect of inverting the learned noise. This requires sampling from a randomized circuit family associated with the user’s original circuit. Applying PEC will increase the variability of the returned expectation value estimates unless the number of samples per circuit is also increased for both input and characterization circuits. The amount of samples required to counter this variability scales exponentially with the noise strength of the mitigated circuit."
