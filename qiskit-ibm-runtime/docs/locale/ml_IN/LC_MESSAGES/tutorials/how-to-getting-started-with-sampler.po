msgid "The Sampler primitive lets you more accurately contextualize counts. It takes a user circuit as an input and generates an error-mitigated readout of quasiprobabilities. This enables you to more efficiently evaluate the possibility of multiple relevant data points in the context of destructive interference."

msgid "A Qiskit Runtime **session** allows you to group a collection of iterative calls to the quantum computer. A session is started when the first job within the session is started. Subsequent jobs within the session are prioritized by the scheduler to minimize artificial delay within an iterative algorithm. Data used within a session, such as transpiled circuits, is also cached to avoid unnecessary overhead. You can create a Runtime session using the context manager (``with ...:``), which automatically opens and closes the session for you."
