msgid "The Qiskit Runtime interface includes two packages: Qiskit IBM Provider (the ``qiskit_ibm_provider`` package) and Qiskit IBM Runtime (the ``qiskit_ibm_runtime`` package). Until now, primitives (``Sampler`` and ``Estimator``) were run in Runtime. Custom circuits that were manually transpiled and used ``IBMBackend.run()`` were run in Provider."

msgid "In this release, we add support for running custom circuits using ``IBMBackend.run()`` in Runtime, so users can run all programs through Runtime."
