msgid "The role of the ``Sampler`` primitive is two-fold: it acts as an **entry point** to quantum devices or simulators, replacing ``backend.run()``. Additionally, it is an **algorithmic abstraction** to extract probability distributions from measurement counts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-sampler.rst:31
msgid "Both ``Sampler`` and  ``backend.run()`` take in circuits as inputs. The main difference is the format of the output: ``backend.run()`` outputs **counts**, while ``Sampler`` processes those counts and outputs the **quasi-probability distribution** associated with them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-sampler.rst:38
msgid "**Backend.run() model:** In this model, you used the ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` (now migrated to ``qiskit-ibm-provider``) module to access real backends and remote simulators. To run **local** simulations, you could import a specific backend from ``qiskit-aer``. All of them followed the ``backend.run()`` interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-sampler.rst:88
msgid "**Primitives model:** Access real backends and remote simulators through the `qiskit-ibm-runtime` **primitives** (`Sampler` and `Estimator`). To run **local** simulations, import specific `local` primitives from |qiskit_aer.primitives|_ and |qiskit.primitives|_. All of them follow the |BaseSampler|_ and |BaseEstimator|_ interfaces, but **only the Runtime primitives offer access to the Runtime service, sessions, and built-in error mitigation**."

msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-sampler.rst:242
msgid "While the user-side syntax of the ``Sampler`` is very similar to  ``backend.run()``, notice that the workflow is now simplified, as the quasi-probability distribution is returned **directly** (no need to perform post-processing), together with some key metadata."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-sampler.rst:274
msgid "Be careful with the output format. With ``Sampler``, the states are no longer represented by bit strings, for example, ``\"11\"``, but by integers, for example, ``3``. To convert the ``Sampler`` output to bit strings, you can use the |QuasiDistribution.binary_probabilities|_ method, as shown below."
