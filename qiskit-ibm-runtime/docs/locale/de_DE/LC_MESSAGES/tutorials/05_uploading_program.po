msgid "Here we provide an overview on how to construct and upload a runtime program. A runtime program is a piece of Python code that lives in the cloud and can be invoked by passing in just its parameters. Runtime programs are private by default, which means only you can see and access your programs. Some authorized users can also mark their programs as public, making them visible and accessible by everyone."

This method takes a parameter ``final`` that indicates whether it’s a final result. However, it is recommended to return the final result directly from the ``main()`` function. Currently only final results are stored after a program execution finishes."

msgid "Runtime programs live in the cloud, and JSON is the standard way of passing data to and from cloud services. Therefore, when a user invokes a runtime program, the input parameters must first be serialized into the JSON format and then deserialized once received by the server. By default, this serialization and deserialization is done automatically using the `RuntimeEncoder <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeEncoder.html#qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeEncoder>`__ and `RuntimeDecoder <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder.html#qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder>`__ classes."

msgid "When ``RuntimeEncoder`` serializes a Python object, it checks whether the object has a ``to_json()`` method. If so, it calls the method to serialize the object. ``RuntimeDecoder``, however, does *not* invoke ``from_json()`` to convert the data back because it doesn’t know how to import your custom class. Therefore the deserialization needs to be done explicitly."
