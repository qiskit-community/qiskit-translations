msgid "The primary method by which information is obtained from quantum computers is via expectation values. Indeed, the samples that come from executing a quantum circuit multiple times, once converted to probabilities, can be viewed as just a finite sample approximation to the expectation value for the projection operators corresponding to each bitstring. More practically, many quantum algorithms require computing expectation values over Pauli operators, e.g. Variational Quantum Eigensolvers, and thus having a runtime program that computes these quantities is of fundamental importance. Here we look at one such example, where a user passes one or more circuits and expectation operators and gets back the computed expectation values, and possibly error bounds."
