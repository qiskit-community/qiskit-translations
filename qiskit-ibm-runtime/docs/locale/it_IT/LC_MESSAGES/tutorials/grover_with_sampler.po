msgid "In the olden days, you looked up a person’s phone number in a phone book. That is an easy task if you know the person’s name because a phone book is ordered alphabetically by name. However, the opposite task, that is, you are given a phone number and want to find out who it belongs to, is much more difficult. That is because a phone book is not ordered by phone numbers. This is an example of an unstructured search problem. To solve this problem with a classical computer, your best trick is to randomly pick an entry. On average, you will need to look up half of the entries (:math:`N/2`, if :math:`N` is the total number of entries) to find the owner. If you have a quantum computer, however, you can use Grover’s algorithm to find the owner in :math:`\\sqrt N` tries. That means to identify the owner in a phone book that has 1 million numbers, you only need to do 1000 tries instead of 500,000!"

#: ../../tutorials/grover_with_sampler.ipynb:48
msgid "In a nutshell, Grover’s algorithm uses a nice quantum trick called amplitude amplification to dramatically increase the chances of finding the correct answer - the owner of a phone number - in each try (iteration). That’s all you need to know now. You don’t have to understand the details about how Grover’s algorithm works to apply it, because Qiskit does it for you! However, if you are interested, you can read the chapter about Grover’s algorithm in `the Qiskit textbook <https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html>`__."
