msgid "The Lite plan is free. The Standard plan charges you per *runtime second*. The following diagram illustrates what is included in a runtime second. For this service, one runtime second includes quantum compute time as well as classical near-time pre- and post-processing time. Any time spent waiting for results or in the queue for the quantum computer are excluded from the classical processing time."

#: ../../cloud/plans.rst:52
msgid "This diagram shows that everything before the program starts (such as queuing) is free. After the job starts, it costs $1.60 per second."

#: ../../cloud/plans.rst:54
msgid "The quantum and near-time classical compute times are grouped to deliver the best performance of quantum programs. The runtime environment uses near-time classical compute to host in-term hardware-dependent tasks like session management, circuit optimization, and (when supported) error mitigation to optimize the execution of quantum programs."
