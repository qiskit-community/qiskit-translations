msgid "In the olden days, you looked up a person’s phone number in a phone book. That is an easy task if you know the person’s name because a phone book is ordered alphabetically by name. However, the opposite task, that is, you are given a phone number and want to find out who it belongs to, is much more difficult. That is because a phone book is not ordered by phone numbers. This is an example of an unstructured search problem. To solve this problem with a classical computer, your best trick is to randomly pick an entry. On average, you will need to look up half of the entires (:math:`N/2`, if :math:`N` is the total number of entries) to find the owner. If you have a quantum computer, however, you can use Grover’s algorithm to find the owner in :math:`\\sqrt N` tries. That means to identify the owner in a phone book that has 1 million numbers, you only need to do 1000 tries instead of 500,000!"
msgstr "옛날에는 전화번호부에서 전화번호를 찾았다. 전화번호부에는 이름이 가나다 순으로 정렬되어 있기 때문에 이름만 알면 찾기 쉬웠다. 그러나 반대로, 전화번호로 이름을 찾는 것은 매우 어려운 일이다. 이는 전화번호부가 전화번호순으로 정렬되어 있지 않기 때문이며, 이것이 비정형 검색 문제의 한 예이다. 고전 컴퓨터로 이 문제를 푸는 가장 좋은 방법은 무작위로 시작점을 선택하는 것이다. 그러면 평균적으로 전체 전화번보후 항목의 절반(:math:`N/2`, 전체 항목 수가 :math:`N` 이라고 했을 때)을 살펴봐야한다. 그러나 양자 컴퓨터로는 그로버 알고리즘을 사용해서 :math:`\\sqrt N` 번 만에 이름을 찾을 수 있다. 100만 개의 항목이 있는 전화번호부라면 50만 번이 아닌, 단 1000번 만에 이름을 찾을 수 있다!"

msgid "In a nutshell, Grover’s algorithm uses a nice quantum trick called amplitude amplification to dramatically increase the chances of finding the correct answer - the owner of a phone number - in each try (iteration). That’s all you need to know now. You don’t have to understand the details about how Grover’s algorithm works to apply it, because Qiskit does it for you! However, if you are interested, you can read the chapter about Grover’s algorighm in `the Qiskit textbook <https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html>`__."
