msgid "Introduction to sessions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:4
msgid "A session allows a collection of jobs to be grouped and jointly scheduled by the Qiskit Runtime service, facilitating iterative use of quantum computers without incurring queuing delays on each iteration. This eliminates artificial delays caused by other users’ jobs running on the same quantum device during the session."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:9
msgid "Compared with jobs that use the `fair-share scheduler <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/docs/iql/manage/systems/queue>`__, sessions become particularly beneficial when running programs that require iterative calls between classical and quantum resources, where a large number of jobs are submitted sequentially. This is the case, for example, when training a variational algorithm such as VQE or QAOA, or in device characterization experiments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:11
msgid "Runtime sessions can be used in conjunction with Qiskit Runtime primitives. Primitive program interfaces vary based on the type of task that you want to run on the quantum computer and the corresponding data that you want returned as a result. After identifying the appropriate primitive for your program, you can use Qiskit to prepare inputs, such as circuits, observables (for Estimator), and customizable options to optimize your job. For more information, see the `Primitives <primitives.html>`__ topic."

msgid "There are several benefits to using sessions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:18
msgid "Jobs that belong to a single algorithm run are run together without interruption, increasing efficiency if your program submits multiple sequential jobs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:21
msgid "The queuing time does not decrease for the first job submitted within a session. Therefore, a session does not provide any benefits if you only need to run a single job."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:22
msgid "Since data from the first session job is cached and used by subsequent jobs, if the first job is cancelled, subsequent session jobs will all fail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:24
msgid "When using sessions, the uncertainty around queuing time is significantly reduced. This allows better estimation of a workload's total runtime and better resource management."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:25
msgid "In a device characterization context, being able to run experiments closely together helps prevent device drifts and provide more accurate results."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:26
msgid "While the session is active, you can submit different jobs, inspect job results, and re-submit new jobs without opening a new session."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:27
msgid "You maintain the flexibility to deploy your programs either remotely (cloud / on-premises) or locally (your laptop)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:30
msgid "The mechanics of sessions (queuing)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:32
msgid "For each backend, the first job in the session waits its turn in the queue normally, but while the session is active, subsequent jobs within the same session take priority over any other queued jobs. If no jobs that are part of the active session are ready, the session is deactivated (paused), and the next job from the regular fair-share queue is run. See :ref:`ttl` for more information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:34
msgid "A quantum processor still executes one job at a time. Therefore, jobs that belong to a session still need to wait for their turn if one is already running."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:37
msgid "Internal systems jobs such as calibration have priority over session jobs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:40
msgid "Maximum session timeout"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:42
msgid "When a session is started, it is assigned a *maximum session timeout* value. You can set this value by using the ``max_time`` parameter, which can be greater than the program's ``max_execution_time``. For instructions, see `Run a primitive in a session <how_to/run_session.html>`__."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:47
msgid "If you do not specify a timeout value, it is set to the system limit."

msgid "Interactive timeout value"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:57
msgid "Every session has an *interactive timeout value* (ITTL, or interactive time to live). If there are no session jobs queued within the ITTL window, the session is temporarily deactivated and normal job selection resumes. A deactivated session can be resumed if it has not reached its maximum timeout value. The session is resumed when a subsequent session job starts. Once a session is deactivated, its next job waits in the queue like other jobs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:64
msgid "After a session is deactivated, the next job in the queue is selected to run. This newly selected job (which can belong to a different user) can run as a singleton, but it can also start a different session. In other words, a deactivated session does not block the creation of other sessions. Jobs from this new session would then take priority until it is deactivated or closed, at which point normal job selection resumes."

msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:78
msgid "A session ends by reaching its maximum timeout value,  when it is `closed <how_to/run_session#close_session.html>`__, or when it is canceled by using the `session.cancel()` method. What happens to unfinished session jobs when the session ends depends on how it ended:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sessions.rst:82
msgid "Previously, `session.close()` **canceled** the session.  Starting with `qiskit-ibm-runtime` 0.13, `session.close()` **closes** the session. The `session.cancel()` method was added in `qiskit-ibm-runtime` 0.13."
