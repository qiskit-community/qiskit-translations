This value has to be greater than the ``max_execution_time`` of the job and less than the system’s ``max_time``. The default value is the system’s ``max_time``.

This means that the session will finish processing all running or queued jobs until the maximum timeout value is reached.  After all jobs are completed, the session is immediately closed. This allows the scheduler to run the next job without waiting for the session interactive timeout, therefore reducing the average job queueing time. You cannot submit jobs to a closed session."
