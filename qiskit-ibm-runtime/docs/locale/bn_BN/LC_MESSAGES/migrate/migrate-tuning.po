msgid "One of the advantages of the primitives is that they abstract away the circuit execution setup so that algorithm developers can focus on the pure algorithmic components. However, sometimes, to get the most out of an algorithm, you might want to tune certain primitive options. This section describes some of the common settings you might need."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:16
msgid "This section focuses on Qiskit Runtime primitive :class:`.Options` (imported from ``qiskit_ibm_runtime``). While most of the `primitives` interface is common across implementations, most :class:`.Options` are not. Consult the corresponding API references for information about the |qiskit.primitives|_ and |qiskit_aer.primitives|_ options."

msgid "1. Shots"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:23
msgid "For some algorithms, setting a specific number of shots is a core part of their routines. Previously, shots could be set during the call to `backend.run()`. For example, ``backend.run(shots=1024)``. Now, that setting is part of the execution options (\"second level option\"). This can be done during the primitive setup:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:36
msgid "If you need to modify the number of shots set between iterations (primitive calls), you can set the shots directly in the ``run()`` method. This overwrites the initial ``shots`` setting."

msgid "For more information about the primitive options, refer to the `Options class API reference <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.Options.html#qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.Options>`_."

msgid "2. Transpilation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:58
msgid "By default, the Qiskit Runtime primitives perform circuit transpilation. The optimization level you choose affects the transpilation strategy and might include additional error suppression mechanisms. Level 0 only involves basic transpilation. To learn about each optimization level, view the Optimization level table in the `Error suppression topic <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/how_to/error-suppression.html#setting-the-optimization-level>`__."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:63
msgid "When using primitives, optimization levels 2 and 3 behave like level 1. If you want to use more advanced optimization, use the Qiskit transpiler locally and then pass the transpiled circuits to the primitives. For instructions see the `Submitting user-transpiled circuits using primitives <https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/tutorial/submitting-user-transpiled-circuits-using-primitives>`__ tutorial."

msgid "To specify settings that are not available through the primitives interface or use custom transpiler passes,  set ``skip_transpilation=True`` to submit user-transpiled circuits.

msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:114
msgid "You might want to use different error mitigation methods and see how these affect the performance of your algorithm. These can also be set through the ``resilience_level`` option. The method selected for each level is different for ``Sampler`` and ``Estimator``. You can find more information in the `Configure error mitigation topic <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/how_to/error-mitigation.html>`_."
