msgid "The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid iterative method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. You can learn more about this algorithm `here <https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-applications/solving-combinatorial-optimization-problems-using-qaoa>`__. In this tutorial we demonstrate how to implement the QAOA algorithm using Qiskit Runtime for solving a simple max-cut problem."

msgid "In a max-cut problem, we want to partition nodes of a graph in a way that maximizes the number of edges between nodes in differing groups. The desired max-cut partition for the graph below is clear: the 0th-node on the left should be separated from the rest of the nodes on the right by a cut. We will find this answer by applying QAOA by using Qiskit Runtime primitives and sessions."

In this tutorial, the ``ibmq_qasm_simlator`` is chosen."

msgid "To utilize QAOA algorithm for a max-cut problem we require a Pauli Hamiltonian that encodes the cost in a manner such that the minimum expectation value of the operator corresponds to the maximum number of edges between the nodes in two different groups."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/qaoa_with_primitives.ipynb:131
msgid "For this simple example, the operator is a linear combination of terms with ``Z`` operators on nodes connected by an edge (recall that the 0th qubit is farthest right): :math:`IIIZZ + IIZIZ + IZIIZ + ZIIIZ`. Once the operator is constructed, the ansatz for the QAOA algorithm can easily be built by using the ``QAOAAnsatz`` circuit from the Qiskit circuit library."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/qaoa_with_primitives.ipynb:173
msgid "Above, we show the ansatz in basic gates for clarity. However, it can be expressed in multiple levels of decomposition by changing the ``reps`` argument or by drawing the circuit without the ``decompose`` method. For example, the following representation directly shows the QAOA structure with the default ``reps`` value, which is ``reps=1``."

msgid "Because we are iteratively executing many calls to Runtime, we make use of a ``Session`` in order to execute all calls within a single block. Moreover, for QAOA, the solution is encoded in the output distribution of the ansatz circuit bound with the optimal parameters from the minimization. Therefore, we will need a ``Sampler`` primitive as well, and will instantiate it with the same ``Session``."
