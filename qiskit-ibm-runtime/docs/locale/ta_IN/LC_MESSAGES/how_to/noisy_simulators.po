msgid "To demonstrate the routine, we shall proceed with running an example routine. One of the major benefits of using primitives is simplification of binding multiple parameters in parameterized circuits. To check this, here is an example circuit with a controlled `P-gate <https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.PhaseGate.html>`__ as implemented right below. Here, we parametrise the ``P-gate`` with a rotation parameter ``theta``. To learn how to create circuits and bind parameters to them by using Qiskit, see the `Circuit Basics <https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/01_circuit_basics.html>`__ and `Advanced Circuits <https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits_advanced/01_advanced_circuits.html#Parameterized-circuits>`__ in Qiskit documentation."

The noise model can be extracted from the ``FakeBackend`` and passed as a ``simulator`` parameter in options.
