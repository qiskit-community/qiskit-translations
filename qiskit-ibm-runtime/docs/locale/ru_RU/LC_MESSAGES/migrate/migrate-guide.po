msgid "This guide describes key patterns of behavior and use cases with code examples to help you migrate code from the legacy ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` package to use the Qiskit Runtime primitives."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-guide.rst:7
msgid "The primitives are the recommended tool to write quantum algorithms, as they encapsulate common device queries seen in application packages, and allow for managed performance through the Qiskit Runtime service. However, if your algorithm requires more granular information, such as pre-shot measurements, the primitives might not provide the desired abstraction level. You can refer to the restructured ``qiskit-ibm-provider`` package, and its corresponding `migration guide <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_provider/tutorials/Migration_Guide_from_qiskit-ibmq-provider.html>`_ for further information on alternatives to the Qiskit Runtime primitives."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-guide.rst:15
msgid "The Qiskit Runtime primitives implement the reference ``Sampler`` and ``Estimator`` interfaces found in `qiskit.primitives <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/primitives.html>`_. These interfaces let you switch between primitive implementations with minimal code changes. Different primitive implementations can be found in the ``qiskit``, ``qiskit_aer``, and ``qiskit_ibm_runtime`` library. Each implementation serves a specific purpose:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-guide.rst:35

msgstr ""
