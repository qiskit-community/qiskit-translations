msgid "`Variational quantum algorithms <https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09265>`__ are promising candidate hybrid-algorithms for observing the utility of quantum computation on noisy near-term devices. Variational algorithms are characterized by the use of a classical optimization algorithm to iteratively update a parameterized trial solution, or \"ansatz\". Chief among these methods is the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) that aims to solve for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian represented as a linear combination of Pauli terms, with an ansatz circuit where the number of parameters to optimize over is polynomial in the number of qubits. Given that size of the full solution vector is exponential in the number of qubits, successful minimization using VQE requires, in general, additional problem specific information to define the structure of the ansatz circuit."

The highest optimization level is much smarter and uses lots of tricks to reduce the overall gate count. Since multi-qubit gates have high error rates and qubits decohere over time, the shorter circuits should give better results."

With the Qiskit Runtime ```Estimator`` <https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Estimator>`__ directly taking a Hamiltonian and parameterized ansatz, and returning the necessary energy, the cost function for a VQE instance is quite simple:"
