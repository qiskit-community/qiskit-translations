"A free plan that gives you access to quantum simulators to help you get "
"started with Qiskit Runtime. It does not include access to IBM Quantum "
"systems. The following simulators are included in this plan:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cloud/plans.rst:14
msgid ""
"``ibmq_qasm_simulator``: A general-purpose simulator for simulating "
"quantum circuits both ideally and subject to noise modeling. The "
"simulation method is automatically selected based on the input circuits "
"and parameters."

"``simulator_statevector``: Simulates a quantum circuit by computing the "
"wave function of the qubit’s state vector as gates and instructions are "
"applied. Supports general noise modeling."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cloud/plans.rst:21
msgid "**Type**: Schrödinger wave function"

" states with weak entanglement."

"queue for the quantum computer are excluded."
