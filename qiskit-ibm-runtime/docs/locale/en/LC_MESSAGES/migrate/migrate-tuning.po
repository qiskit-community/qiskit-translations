"One of the advantages of the primitives is that they abstract away the "
"circuit execution setup so that algorithm developers can focus on the "
"pure algorithmic components. However, sometimes, to get the most out of "
"an algorithm, you might want to tune certain primitive options. This "
"section describes some of the common settings you might need."

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:16
msgid ""
"This section focuses on Qiskit Runtime primitive :class:`.Options` "
"(imported from ``qiskit_ibm_runtime``). While most of the `primitives` "
"interface is common across implementations, most :class:`.Options` are "
"not. Consult the corresponding API references for information about the "
"|qiskit.primitives|_ and |qiskit_aer.primitives|_ options."

msgid "1. Shots"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:23
msgid ""
"For some algorithms, setting a specific number of shots is a core part of"
" their routines. Previously, shots could be set during the call to "
"`backend.run()`. For example, ``backend.run(shots=1024)``. Now, that "
"setting is part of the execution options (\"second level option\"). This "
"can be done during the primitive setup:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:36
msgid ""
"If you need to modify the number of shots set between iterations "
"(primitive calls), you can set the shots directly in the ``run()`` "
"method. This overwrites the initial ``shots`` setting."

msgstr ""

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:58
msgid ""
"By default, the Qiskit Runtime primitives perform circuit transpilation. "
"There are several optimization levels you can choose from. These levels "
"affect the transpilation strategy and might include additional error "
"suppression mechanisms. Level 0 only involves basic transpilation. To "
"learn about each optimization level, view the Optimization level table in"
" the `Error suppression topic "

"The optimization level option is a \"first level option\", and can be set"
" as follows:"

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:79

"You might want to configure your transpilation strategy further, and for "
"this, there are advanced transpilation options you can set up. These are "
"\"second level options\", and can be set as follows:"

"For more information, and a complete list of advanced transpilation "

"Finally, you might want to specify settings that are not available "
"through the primitives interface, or use custom transpiler passes. In "
"these cases, you can set ``skip_transpilation=True`` to submit user-"
"transpiled circuits. To learn how this is done, refer to the `Submitting "
"user-transpiled circuits using primitives tutorial "

#: ../../migrate/migrate-tuning.rst:115
msgid ""
"You might want to leverage different error mitigation methods and see how"
" these affect the performance of your algorithm. These can also be set "
"through the ``resilience_level`` option. The method selected for each "
"level is different for ``Sampler`` and ``Estimator``. You can find more "
