"Primitives are the recommended tool to write quantum algorithms, as they "
"encapsulate common device queries seen in application packages and allow "
"for managed performance through the Qiskit Runtime service. However, if "
"your algorithm requires more granular information, such as pre-shot "
"measurements, the primitives might not provide the desired abstraction "
"level."

"The Qiskit Runtime primitives implement the reference ``Sampler`` and "
"``Estimator`` interfaces found in `qiskit.primitives "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/primitives.html>`_. These "
"interfaces let you switch between primitive implementations with minimal "
"code changes. Different primitive implementations can be found in the "
"``qiskit``, ``qiskit_aer``, and ``qiskit_ibm_runtime`` library. Each "
"implementation serves a specific purpose:"
