"The role of the ``Estimator`` primitive is two-fold: it acts as an "
"**entry point** to quantum devices or simulators, replacing the "
"``Backend`` interface (commonly referred to as ``backend.run()``). "
"Additionally, it is an **algorithmic abstraction** for expectation value "
"calculations, so you don't have to manually construct the final "
"expectation circuit. This results in a considerable reduction of the code"
" complexity and a more compact algorithm design."

"**Backend.run() model:** In this model, you accessed real backends and "
"remote simulators using the ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` module (now migrated"

"import a specific backend from ``qiskit-aer``. All of them followed the "
"``backend.run()`` interface."

"**Primitives model:** Access real backends and remote simulators through "
"the ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` **primitives** (``Sampler`` and "

"`local` primitives from |qiskit_aer.primitives|_ and "
"|qiskit.primitives|_. All of them follow the |BaseSampler|_ and "

"If your code previously calculated expectation values using "

"handle operators and state functions. To support this scenario, the "
"following migration example shows how to replace the (|qiskit.opflow|_ & "
