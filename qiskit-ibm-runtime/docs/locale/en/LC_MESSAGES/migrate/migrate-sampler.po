"The role of the ``Sampler`` primitive is two-fold: it acts as an **entry "
"point** to quantum devices or simulators, replacing ``backend.run()``. "
"Additionally, it is an **algorithmic abstraction** to extract probability"
" distributions from measurement counts."

msgid ""
"Both ``Sampler`` and  ``backend.run()`` take in circuits as inputs. The "
"main difference is the format of the output: ``backend.run()`` outputs "
"**counts**, while ``Sampler`` processes those counts and outputs the "
"**quasi-probability distribution** associated with them."

"**Backend.run() model:** In this model, you used the ``qiskit-ibmq-"
"provider`` (now migrated to ``qiskit-ibm-provider``) module to access "
"real backends and remote simulators. To run **local** simulations, you "
"could import a specific backend from ``qiskit-aer``. All of them followed"
" the ``backend.run()`` interface."

"**Primitives model:** Access real backends and remote simulators through "
"the `qiskit-ibm-runtime` **primitives** (`Sampler` and `Estimator`). To "

"|qiskit_aer.primitives|_ and |qiskit.primitives|_. All of them follow the"
" |BaseSampler|_ and |BaseEstimator|_ interfaces, but **only the Runtime "
"primitives offer access to the Runtime service, sessions, and built-in "
