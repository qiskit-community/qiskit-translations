"Using **Runtime Sessions** can be particularly advantageous when working "
"with variational algorithms, as they present iterative workloads that can"
" submit multiple jobs per iteration. On top of this, the runtime "
"primitives allow to try out different error mitigation techniques with no"
" changes to the algorithm, just a simple option configuration."
