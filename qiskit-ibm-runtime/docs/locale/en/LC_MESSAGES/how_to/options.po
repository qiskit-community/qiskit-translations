"No computing platform is perfect, and because quantum computers are such "
"new and complex technology, we have to find new ways of dealing with "
"these imperfections.  There are several possible causes for errors: "
"“noise” - disturbances in the physical environment, and “bit errors”, "
"which cause the qubit's value or phase to change.  IBM builds redundancy "
"into the hardware to ensure that even if some qubits error out, an "
"accurate result is still returned.  However, we can further address "
"errors by using error suppression and error mitigation techniques  These "
"strategies make use of pre- and post-processing to improve the quality of"
" the results produced for the input circuit."

"**Error suppression**: Techniques that optimize and transform your "
"circuit at the point of compilation to minimize errors. This is the most "
"basic error handling technique.  Error suppression typically results in "
"some classical pre-processing overhead to your overall runtime."

"Primitives let you employ error suppression techniques by setting the "
"optimization level (``optimization_level`` option) and by choosing "
"advanced transpilation options.  See `Configure error suppression <error-"
"suppression.html>`__ for details."

msgid ""
"**Error mitigation**: Techniques that allow users to mitigate circuit "
"errors by modeling the device noise at the time of execution. This "
"typically results in quantum pre-processing overhead related to model "
"training, and classical post-processing overhead to mitigate errors in "
"the raw results by using the generated model."

"The error mitigation techniques built in to primitives are advanced "
"resilience options.   To specify these options, use the "
"``resilience_level`` when submitting your job.  See `Configure error "
