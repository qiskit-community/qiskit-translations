"A Qiskit Runtime session allows you to group a collection of iterative "
"calls to the quantum computer. A session is started when the first job "
"within the session is started. As long as the session is active, "
"subsequent jobs within the session are prioritized by the scheduler to "
"minimize artificial delay within an iterative algorithm. Data used within"
" a session, such as transpiled circuits, is also cached to avoid "
"unnecessary overhead. As a result, sessions allow you to more efficiently"
" run programs that require iterative calls between classical and quantum "
"resources while giving you the flexibility to deploy your programs "
"remotely on cloud or on-premise classical resources (including your "
"laptop)."

"You can set up a runtime session by using the context manager (``with "
