"This tutorial demonstrates the ability to send flexible circuits to the "
"``Sampler`` primitive by performing a simple example of the spectroscopic"
" eigensolver algorithm (`arXiv:2202.12910 "
"<http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12910>`__). The SEA is used for quantum "
"simulation of model Hamiltonians, and works by interacting a “probe” "
"auxiliary qubit with a simulation register. The energy of the probe qubit"
" is swept and eigenvalues of the simulation Hamiltonian are observed as "
"peaks or dips in the response, akin to the experimental tool of "
"spectroscopy. Because each point (i.e., energy) is a different quantum "
"circuit, this technique is expensive with respect to the number of "
"circuits required. The ``Sampler`` provides the flexibility to send just "
"a single circuit with the needed ``Parameter``\\ s passed."

"From the time-evolution operator :math:`U_{\\rm ham}`, we use the Suzuki-"

"steps (more Trotter steps), the more accurate the quantum circuit, but "

"quantum hardware. We then transpile the circuits to IBM backend basis "
"gates and measure only the probe qubit ``q0``."
