"Qiskit Runtime is a quantum computing service and programming model that "
"allows users to optimize workloads and efficiently execute them on "
"quantum systems at scale. The programming model extends the existing "
"interface in Qiskit with a set of new primitive programs."

"Primitives are predefined programs that provide a simplified interface "
"for defining near-time quantum-classical workloads required to "
"efficiently build and customize applications. The initial release of "
"Qiskit Runtime includes two primitives: Estimator and Sampler. They "
"perform foundational quantum computing tasks and act as an entry point to"
" the Qiskit Runtime service."

msgid "**Sampler**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:31
msgid ""
"This is a program that takes a user circuit as an input and generates an "
"error-mitigated readout of quasiprobabilities. This provides users a way "
"to better evaluate shot results using error mitigation and enables them "
"to more efficiently evaluate the possibility of multiple relevant data "
"points in the context of destructive interference."

msgid "**Estimator**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:39
msgid ""
"The estimator primitive allows users to efficiently calculate and "
"interpret expectation values of quantum operators required for many "
"algorithms. Users specify a list of circuits and observables, then tell "
"the program how to selectively group between the lists to efficiently "
"evaluate expectation values and variances for a given parameter input."
