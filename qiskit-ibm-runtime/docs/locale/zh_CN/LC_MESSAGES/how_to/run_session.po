msgid "There are several ways to set up and use sessions. The following information should not be considered mandatory steps to follow. Instead, choose the configuration that best suits your needs. To learn more about sessions, see `Introduction to sessions <../sessions.html>`__. This information assumes that you are using Qiskit Runtime `primitives <../primitives.html>`__."

msgid "You can open a runtime session by using the context manager `with Session(…)` or by initializing the `Session` class. When you start a session, you can specify options, such as the backend to run on. This topic describes the most commonly used options.  For the full list, see the `Sessions API documentation <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session.html#qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session>`__."

msgid "When you start a session, you can specify session options, such as the backend to run on. A backend is required if you are using the IBM Quantum channel, but optional if you are using the IBM Cloud channel. Once specified, you cannot change the backend used for a session and you cannot specify multiple backends within a session.  To use a different backend, open a new session."

You can no longer submit jobs to that session.  See `What happens when a session ends <../sessions.html#ends>`__ for further details."

msgid "You can configure the maximum session timeout value through the `max_time` parameter, which can be specified as seconds (int) or a string, like \"2h 30m 40s\".  This value has to be greater than the `max_execution_time` of the job and less than the system’s `max_time`. The default value is the system’s `max_time`.
