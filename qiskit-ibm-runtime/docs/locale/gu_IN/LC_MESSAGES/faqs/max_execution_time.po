#: ../../faqs/max_execution_time.rst:10
msgid "To ensure fairness, and as a way to help control cost, there is a maximum execution time for each Qiskit Runtime job. If a job exceeds this time limit, it is forcibly cancelled and a ``RuntimeJobMaxTimeoutError`` exception is raised."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs/max_execution_time.rst:16
msgid "As of August 7, 2023, the ``max_execution_time`` value is based on quantum time instead of wall clock time. Quantum time represents the time that the QPU complex (including control software, control electronics, QPU, and so on) is engaged in processing the job."

msgid "Simulator jobs continue to use wall clock time because they do not have quantum time."

msgid "You can also find quantum time used by previously completed jobs by using:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs/max_execution_time.rst:42
msgid "In addition, the system calculates an appropriate job timeout value based on the input circuits and options. This system-calculated timeout is currently capped at 3 hours to ensure fair device usage. If a ``max_execution_time`` is also specified for the job, the lesser of the two values is used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs/max_execution_time.rst:47
msgid "For example, if you specify ``max_execution_time=5000``, but the system determines it should not take more than 5 minutes (300 seconds) to execute the job, then the job will be cancelled after 5 minutes."

msgid "Session time limits"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faqs/max_execution_time.rst:54
msgid "When a session is started, it is assigned a maximum session timeout value. After this timeout is reached, the session is terminated, any jobs that are already running continue running, and any queued jobs that remain in the session are put into a ``failed`` state. You can set the maximum session timeout value using the ``max_time`` parameter:"

msgid "Additionally, there is a 5 minute *interactive* timeout value. If there are no session jobs queued within that window, the session is temporarily deactivated and normal job selection resumes. During job selection, if the job scheduler gets a new job from the session and its maximum timeout value has not been reached, the session is reactivated until its maximum timeout value is reached."
