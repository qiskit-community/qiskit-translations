msgid "The violation of the CHSH inequality is used to show that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. This is an important experiment for understanding the foundation of quantum mechanics. The 2022 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger in part for their pioneering work in quantum information science, and in particular, their experiments with entangled photons demonstrating violation of Bell’s inequalities. An experimental method by which one can test Bell’s inequality was put forth by Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt (CHSH) in 1969, and forms the basis for the experiment conducted here. It's truly incredible that you can use Qiskit and an IBM Quantum system to conduct this experiment from the comfort of your home!"

As you will see, the Estimator primitive makes running parameterized circuits very easy. Rather than creating a series of CHSH circuits, you only need to create *one* CHSH circuit with a parameter specifying the measurement angle and a series of phase values for the parameter."
