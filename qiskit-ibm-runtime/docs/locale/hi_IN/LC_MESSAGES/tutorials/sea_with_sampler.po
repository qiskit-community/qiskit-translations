msgid "This tutorial demonstrates the ability to send flexible circuits to the ``Sampler`` primitive by performing a simple example of the Spectroscopic Eigensolver Algorithm (SEA) (`arXiv:2202.12910 <http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12910>`__). The SEA is used for quantum simulation of model Hamiltonians, and works by interacting a \"probe\" auxiliary qubit with a simulation register. The energy of the probe qubit is swept and eigenvalues of the simulation Hamiltonian are observed as peaks or dips in the response, akin to the experimental tool of spectroscopy. Because each point (energy) is a different quantum circuit, this technique is expensive with respect to the number of circuits required. The ``Sampler`` provides the flexibility to send just a single circuit with the needed ``Parameter``\\ s passed."

The smaller the time steps (more Trotter steps), the more accurate the quantum circuit, but also longer depth, which could introduce errors when executing on noisy quantum hardware. We then transpile the circuits to IBM backend basis gates and measure only the probe qubit ``q0``."
