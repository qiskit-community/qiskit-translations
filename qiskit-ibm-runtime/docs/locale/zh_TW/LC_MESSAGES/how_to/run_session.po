msgid "A Qiskit Runtime session allows you to group a collection of iterative calls to the quantum computer. A session is started when the first job within the session is started. Provided that the session is active, subsequent jobs within the session are prioritized by the scheduler to minimize artificial delay within an iterative algorithm. Data used within a session, such as transpiled circuits, is also cached to avoid unnecessary overhead. As a result, sessions allow you to more efficiently run programs that require iterative calls between classical and quantum resources while giving you the flexibility to deploy your programs remotely on cloud or on-premises classical resources (including your laptop)."

msgid "Additionally, there is an *interactive* timeout value. If there are no session jobs queued within that window, the session is temporarily deactivated and normal job selection resumes. After a session is deactivated, a subsequent job could start an additional session.  Jobs for the new session would then take priority until the new session deactivates or is closed. After the new session becomes inactive, if the job scheduler gets a job from the original session and its maximum timeout value has not been reached, the session is reactivated until its maximum timeout value is reached."

msgstr ""

#: ../../how_to/run_session.rst:100
msgid "For each backend, the first job in the session waits its turn in the queue normally, but while the session is active, subsequent jobs within the same session take priority over any other queued jobs. If there are no jobs that are part of a session, the next job from the regular fair-share queue is run. Jobs still run one at a time. Therefore, jobs that belong to a session still queue up if you already have one running, but you do not have to wait for them to complete before submitting more jobs."
