 <br>

As a team of Qiskit enthusiasts, we feel that it is important to recognize the contributions that were made by its members to make our documentation more accessible to the global community.

All localization contributors who drove efforts in translating, proof-reading and managing progress can earn a Qiskit Localization Contributor Badge. After you complete the [requirements to earn a badge](#badge-levels), you may submit a request to apply for a digital badge so that the project owners can begin assessment and badge processing.

Yes, of course! You can apply each time you qualify for a badge level, so we encourage you to apply as soon as you qualify.

### :question: When will the badges be issued?
All eligible and verified applicants will have their badges issued within 14 days of a submitted application. After we receive your application, we will ask your language team lead to verify your contributions based on the [Qiskit Code of Conduct](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-translations/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### :question: How are the digital badges administered?
The Qiskit Localization Contributor Badge program is part of the IBM Digital Badge program and leverages the services of Credly's badge platform. Badges issued through Credly are external to IBM, therefore visible to other communities such as LinkedIn. These badges do not expire and are available to the Qiskit community members who have made substantial contributions to the open source community.

### :question: I am new to the team. Can I apply now for the next year?
The current badge application is just for the period April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024. You'll have plenty of time to increase your contributions and apply for the badges.
