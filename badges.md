At Qiskit, we feel that it is important to recognize the contributions that were made by its members to make our documentation more accessible to the global community.

Starting in 2020, localization contributors who drove efforts in translating, proof-reading and managing progress can earn a Qiskit Localization Contributor Badge. After you complete the requirements to earn a badge, you may submit a request to apply for a digital badge so that the project owners can begin assessment and badge processing. Note: Your name must be listed in the [LOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-translations/blob/master/LOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS) list as proof that you have acknowledged Qiskti Code of Conduct, Localization guidelines, and accepted the Contributors License Agreement (CLA) upon joining the project. 

*NOTICE: IBM leverages the services of Credly, a 3rd party data processor authorized by IBM and located in the United States, to assist in the administration of the IBM Digital Badge program. In order to issue you an IBM Digital Badge, your personal information (name, email address, and badge earned) will be shared with Credly. You will receive an email notification from Credly with instructions for claiming the badge. Your personal information is used to issue your badge and for program reporting and operational purposes. It will be handled in a manner consistent with IBM privacy practices. The IBM Privacy Statement can be viewed here: https://www.ibm.com/privacy/us/en/.

## How can I apply for a badge?
Badges are issued on a yearly basis. The organization team will open an application form for all eligible members to apply for their digital badges. 
The application cycle for 2021 localization contribution was closed on March 31, 2022. All eligible and verified applicants will have their badges issued within 14 days after the application is closed. The form for the 2022 application cycle will open by June 2022 and will be notified via Crowdin Messages and #qiskit-localization on the Qiskit Slack workspace.

## How can I verify the number of words I translated?
You can verify the number of words you have translated or approved by logging into [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/qiskit-docs) then go to Settings > Reports > Top Members if you have a manager role. 
If you have a translator role, go to Settings > Reports > My Contribution. Make sure to set the Date Range starting from "2021-04-01" up (for 2021 badge applications) to the day of submitting this form before generating the list to see how many words you have translated or approved so far.

After we receive your application, we will ask your language team lead to verify your contributions based on the [Qiskit Code of Conduct](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-translations/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please note that in case we discover any form of violation of the code of conduct, we cannot issue the relevant badge for you. 

## How are the digital badges administered?
The Qiskit Localization Contributor Badge program is part of the IBM Digital Badge program and leverages the services of Credly's Acclaim. Acclaim badges are external to IBM, therefore visible to other communities such as LinkedIn. These badges do not expire and are available to the Qiskit community members who have made substantial contributions to the open source community.
