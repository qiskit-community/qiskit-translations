msgid "The payoff function equals zero as long as the sum of the spot prices :math:`(S_1 + S_2)` is less than the strike price :math:`K_1` and then increases linearly until the sum of the spot prices reaches :math:`K_2`. Then payoff stays constant to :math:`K_2 - K_1` unless any of the two spot prices exceeds the barrier threshold :math:`B`, then the payoff goes immediately down to zero. The implementation first uses a weighted sum operator to compute the sum of the spot prices into an ancilla register, and then uses a comparator, that flips an ancilla qubit from :math:`\\big|0\\rangle` to :math:`\\big|1\\rangle` if :math:`(S_1 + S_2) \\geq K_1` and another comparator/ancilla to capture the case that :math:`(S_1 + S_2) \\geq K_2`.
