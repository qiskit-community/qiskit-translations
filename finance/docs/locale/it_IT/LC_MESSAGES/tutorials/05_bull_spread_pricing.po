The implementation uses two comparators, that flip an ancilla qubit each from :math:`\\big|0\\rangle` to :math:`\\big|1\\rangle` if :math:`S_T \\geq K_1` and :math:`S_T \\leq K_2`, and these ancillas are used to control the linear part of the payoff function."

However, since we are only interested in the probability of this condition being true, we can directly use an ancilla qubit as the objective qubit in amplitude estimation without any further approximation."
