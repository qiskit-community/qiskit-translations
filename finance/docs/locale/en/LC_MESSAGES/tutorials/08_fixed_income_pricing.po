"Each cash flow is treated as a zero coupon bond with a corresponding "
"interest rate :math:`r_t` that depends on its maturity. The user must "
"specify the distribution modeling the uncertainty in each :math:`r_t` "
"(possibly correlated) as well as the number of qubits he wishes to use to"
" sample each distribution. In this example we expand the value of the "
"asset to first order in the interest rates :math:`r_t`. This corresponds "
"to studying the asset in terms of its duration. The approximation of the "
"objective function follows the following paper: `Quantum Risk Analysis. "
