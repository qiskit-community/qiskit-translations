msgid "Across many problems in finance, one starts with time series. Here, we showcase how to generate pseudo-random time-series, download actual stock-market time series from a number of common providers, and how to compute time-series similarity measures."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/11_time_series.ipynb:64
msgid "Once the data are loaded, you can run a variety of algorithms on those to aggregate the data. Notably, you can compute the covariance matrix or a variant, which would consider alternative time-series similarity measures based on `dynamic time warping <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping>`__ (DTW). In DTW, changes that vary in speed, e.g., one stock’s price following another stock’s price with a small delay, can be accommodated."

msgid "While the access to real-time data usually requires a payment, it is possible to access historical (adjusted) closing prices via Wikipedia and Quandl free of charge, following registration at: https://www.quandl.com/?modal=register In the code below, one needs to specify actual tickers of actual NASDAQ issues and the access token you obtain from Quandl; by running the code below, you agree to the Quandl terms and conditions, including a liability waiver. Notice that at least two tickers are required for the computation of covariance and time-series matrices, but hundreds of tickers may go beyond the fair usage limits of Quandl."

msgid "If and when you have access to NASDAQ Data on Demand using your own token, you should replace REPLACE-ME below with the token. To assure the security of the connection, you should also have your own means of validating NASDAQ’s certificates. The DataOnDemandProvider constructor has an optional argument ``verify``, which can be ``None`` or a string or a boolean. If it is ``None``, certify certificates will be used (default). If verify is a string, it should be pointing to a certificate for the HTTPS connection to NASDAQ (dataondemand.nasdaq.com), either in the form of a CA_BUNDLE file or a directory wherein to look."
