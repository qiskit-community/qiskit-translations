msgid "The payoff function equals zero as long as the sum of the spot prices at maturity :math:`(S_T^1 + S_T^2)` is less than the strike price :math:`K` and then increases linearly. The implementation first uses a weighted sum operator to compute the sum of the spot prices into an ancilla register, and then uses a comparator, that flips an ancilla qubit from :math:`\\big|0\\rangle` to :math:`\\big|1\\rangle` if :math:`(S_T^1 + S_T^2) \\geq K`. This ancilla is used to control the linear part of the payoff function."
