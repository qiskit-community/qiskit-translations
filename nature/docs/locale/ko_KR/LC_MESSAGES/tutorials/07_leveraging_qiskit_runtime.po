msgid "The ``VQEClient`` discussed in this tutorial is **DEPRECATED** as of version 0.6 of Qiskit Nature and will be removed no sooner than 3 months after the release. Instead you should use the new primitives based VQE with the Qiskit IBM Runtime Estimator primitive. For more details on how to migrate check out this guide `here <https://qisk.it/algo_migration#vqe>`__."

msgid "If we send hundreds of jobs iteratively, this overhead quickly dominates the execution time of our algorithm. Qiskit Runtime allows us to tackle these issues and significantly speed up (especially) iterative algorithms. With Qiskit Runtime, one job does not contain only a batch of circuits but the *entire* algorithm. That means we only experience the API overhead and queue wait *once* instead of in every iteration! You'll be able to either upload algorithm parameters and delegate all the complexity to the cloud, where your program is executed, or upload your personal algorithm directly."

msgid "If we are interested in the development of the energy, the ``VQEClient`` allows access to the history of the optimizer, which contains the loss per iteration (along with the parameters and a timestamp). Note that this only holds for the SPSA and QN-SPSA optimizers. Otherwise you have to use a callback to the ``VQEClient``, similar to the normal ``VQE``."
msgstr "만약 에너지의 반복에 따른 변화에 관심이 있다면, ``VQEClient``는 optimizer의 이력에 대한 접근을 허용하는데, 이는 타임스탬프 및 매개변수들과 함께 매 반복당 손실을 포함한다. 이는 SPSA와 QN-SPSA optimizer에 대해서만 성립함에 유의하자. 다른 경우에는, 기존 ``VQE``와 유사하게 ``VQEClient``에 콜백을 사용해야 한다."
