msgid "The keen-eyed among you will have already noticed in the `overview of the design of Qiskit Nature <./00_Migration_Guide_to_v0.5.ipynb>`__ that protein folding was not mentioned at all. The reason for that is simply that it does not align with the vision and goals of Qiskit Nature. Its status was more of a prototype than a continuously developing feature like the other parts of the package and on top of that it is really more a chemistry-inspired *optimization problem* which is not something that is currently in the scope of Qiskit Nature."

msgid "Thus, the entire code related to protein folding has been migrated to the `Qiskit Research repository <https://github.com/qiskit-research/qiskit-research>`__ from where you can still install and use it, just like you have done so far, except with the new import locations based on that package."
