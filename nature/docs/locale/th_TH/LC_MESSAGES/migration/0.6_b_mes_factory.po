msgid "Their benefit over an improved documentation on how to properly set these algorithms up for use with Qiskit Nature has diminished over time. Thus, you can now find proper **How-to guides**, as listed below, detailing how you can achieve the same functionality which used to be provided by these classes. The table below summarizes where you need to look for the steps to replace a factory class:"
