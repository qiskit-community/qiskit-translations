For the particular case we are targeting the single bitstring that gives us the minimum energy (corresponding to the folded structure of the protein). Thus, we can use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) expectation values for the solution of the problem and for finding the minimum configuration energy [6] . We follow the same approach as in Ref. [2] but here we use COBYLA for the classical optimization part. One can also use the standard VQE or QAOA algorithm for the solution of the problem, though as discussed in Ref. [2] CVaR is more suitable."

msgid "In order to reduce computational costs, we have reduced the problem’s qubit operator to the minimum amount of qubits needed to represent the shape of the protein. In order to decode the answer we need to understand how this has been done. \\* The shape of the protein has been encoded by a sequence of turns , :math:`\\{0,1,2,3\\}`. Each turn represents a different direction in the lattice. \\* For a main bead of :math:`N_{aminoacids}` in a lattice, we need :math:`N_{aminoacids}-1` turns in order to represent its shape. However, the orientation of the protein is not relevant to its energy. Therefore the first two turns of the shape can be set to :math:`[1,0]` without loss of generality. \\* If the second bead does not have any side chain, we can also set the :math:`6^{th}` qubit to :math:`[1]` without breaking symmetry. \\* Since the length of the secondary chains is always limited to :math:`1` we only need one turn to describe the shape of the chain."
