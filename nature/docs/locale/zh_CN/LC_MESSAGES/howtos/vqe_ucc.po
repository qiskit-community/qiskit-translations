msgid "Use a UCC-like ansatz with a VQE"
msgstr ""

msgid "When using a :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.UCC`-style ansatz with a :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.VQE` one needs to pay particular attention to the :attr:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.VQE.initial_point` attribute which indicates from which set of initial parameters the optimization routine should start. By default, VQE will start from a *random* initial point. In this how to we show how one can set a custom initial point instead (for example to guarantee that one starts from the Hartree-Fock state)."

msgid "Now comes the key step: choosing the initial point. Since we picked the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.HartreeFock` initial state before, in order to ensure we start from that, we need to initialize our ``initial_point`` with all-zero parameters. One way to do that is like so:"

msgid "This may seem like it is not adding a lot of benefit, but the key aspect here is that you can build your code on top of the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.InitialPoint` interface based on which we also have the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.MP2InitialPoint` which allows you to start from an MP2 starting point like so:"
