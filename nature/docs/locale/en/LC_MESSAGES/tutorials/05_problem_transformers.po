"**Note:** Currently, Qiskit Nature only has transformers which work with "

msgid "The ``BasisTransformer``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/05_problem_transformers.ipynb:27
msgid ""
"This transformer allows you to transform an "
"``ElectronicStructureProblem`` from one basis into another. This is "
"useful in certain settings such as: - when you obtained a problem "
"description or the Hamiltonian coefficients in the AO basis from an "
"external source - when you explicitly generated the problem in the AO "
"basis to modify it manually before transforming into the MO basis - etc."

"Since we can achieve the second scenario directly using Qiskit Nature, "
"that is what we will be doing here. To learn more about how to do this, "
"we recommend that you read the tutorial on the ```QCSchema`` "
"<08_qcschema.ipynb>`__."

"First, we create a problem in the ``AO`` basis in order to demonstrate "
"the basis transformation:"

msgid "Next, we obtain the ``AO`` to ``MO`` transformer:"

#: ../../tutorials/05_problem_transformers.ipynb:200

"And finally, we can use the transformer to obtain the problem in the "

"If you need to construct your ``BasisTransformer`` manually, you can do "

msgid "The ``FreezeCoreTransformer``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/05_problem_transformers.ipynb:336
msgid ""
"This transformer provides you with the very simple means to freeze the "
"*core orbitals* of your molecular system. It requires your problem to "
"contain the ``.molecule`` attribute from which it can extract the atomic "
"information necessary to perform this Hilbert space reduction."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/05_problem_transformers.ipynb:421
msgid ""
"In the following, we apply the ``FreezeCoreTransformer`` which in this "
"case will remove the single lowest energy orbital (reducing the total "
"number of spatial orbitals from 6 to 5) and also removing the two "
"electrons from within that orbital (as reflected by the changed number of"
" particles)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/05_problem_transformers.ipynb:484
msgid ""
"Note, that this transformation will result in a constant energy offset "
"resulting from the removal of the core electrons. This offset is "
"registered inside of the hamiltonianâ€™s ``constants`` attribute, which you"
" can inspect like shown below:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/05_problem_transformers.ipynb:529
msgid ""
"Furthermore, you can provide a list of orbital indices (0-based) which "
"are to be removed from the system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/05_problem_transformers.ipynb:531
msgid ""
"**Note:** these orbitals *must* be unoccupied, otherwise you will incur a"
" large error in your computation (even if they are unoccupied you should "
"know which orbitals you are removing, because removing the wrong ones can"
" still incur large errors if the systems dynamics are altered "
"significantly). No guards are in place to check that the provided orbital"
" indices are indeed unoccupied, so this is up to you!"

msgid "The ``ActiveSpaceTransformer``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/05_problem_transformers.ipynb:586
msgid ""
"This transformer generalizes the Hilbert space reduction which is "
"performed by the ``FreezeCoreTransformer``. Simply put, it allows you to "
"specify an *active space* by selecting the number of active electrons and"
" the number of active spatial orbitals. According to these settings, the "
"active space will be chosen around the Fermi level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/05_problem_transformers.ipynb:735
msgid ""
"The ``ActiveSpaceTransformer`` in Qiskit Nature has one more trick up its"
" sleeve because it even allows you to manually specify the indices of the"
" active orbitals. This enables you to hand-pick active spaces which do "
"not lie continuously around the Fermi level."
