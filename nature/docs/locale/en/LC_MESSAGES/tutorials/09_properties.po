"Qiskit Nature has various built-in “properties”. These objects are "
"effectively operator factories, since they allow the programming of "
"operator blueprints based on a minimal set of required information. Some "
"commonly used examples are the ``ParticleNumber``, ``AngularMomentum`` "
"and ``Magnetization`` properties, all of which take only the system size "
"as their only input, and generate a ``SparseLabelOp`` of the required "
"size."

"These properties can be registered in a ``problem`` instance which will "
"cause them to be evaluated once a ground state and/or excited states of "
"that problem have been found. In the following, we will explain the "
"general concept of how this works."

"The ``BaseProblem`` base class dictates the existence of the "
"``.properties`` attribute on any ``problem`` instance. This attribute is "
"of type ``PropertiesContainer`` which is an object that can hold at most "
"one instance of any ``SparseLabelOpsFactory`` (or property class, as we "
"commonly refer to them)."

"The specific subclasses of ``BaseProblem`` for the various stacks such as"
" `electronic structure <01_electronic_structure.ipynb>`__, `vibrational "
"structure <02_vibrational_structure.ipynb>`__ or `lattice models "
"<10_lattice_models.ipynb>`__ make things even simpler for you, because "
"they provide direct attributes for the built-in properties of Qiskit "

"Note that the ``ElectronicDipoleMoment`` is populated by default. To "
"exclude it, you can use the drivers ``to_problem()`` method and provide "
"the ``include_dipole=False`` keyword argument. Refer to the drivers "
"documentation for more details."

"You can see, that all properties come pre-populated except for the "
"``ElectronicDensity``. But this is easy to add:"
