"The `QCSchema <https://github.com/MolSSI/QCSchema>`__ is a standard data "
"format for quantum chemistry. The current version of it which has been "
"adopted by multiple classical chemistry codes, only supports "
"serialization via ``JSON``, but their docs clearly indicate that ``HDF5``"
" may also be used. Thus, in Qiskit Nature, we have opted for implementing"
" support for both hierarchical data formats."

"Now, why do we have a tutorial specifically about this format you may "
"wonder? The reason is fairly simple: this is the data format which our "
"drivers use internally to transfer data between the classical computation"
" and Qiskit Nature. Thus, this tutorial will explain a few concepts, in "
"case you want to get a bit more elaborate with your driver interaction."

"**Note:** the support for electronic-repulsion integrals as part of the "
"QCSchema is not yet part of the official specification and, thus, custom "
"to Qiskit Nature. But we are working with the QCSchema authors to make "
"this integration official!"

"For the purposes of this tutorial, we are using the ``PySCFDriver``, but "

"drivers, too."

"There are two things to note here: - the problem is specifically "
"requested in the MO basis - dipole integrals are handled separately "
"(because the current QCSchema standard does not support these "
"coefficients)"

"What this means for you as an end-user, is that you can also request the "

"If you now want to transform an AO problem into the MO basis, you need to"
" use the ``BasisTransformer`` which is explained in `a separate tutorial "
"<05_problem_transformers.ipynb>`__."

"This is the point, where you need to understand that the ``to_problem`` "

"Specifically extracting the QCSchema object from the driver allows you to"
