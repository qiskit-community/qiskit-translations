"The keen-eyed among you will have already noticed in the `overview of the"
" design of Qiskit Nature <./00_Migration_Guide_to_v0.5.ipynb>`__ that "
"protein folding was not mentioned at all. The reason for that is simply "
"that it does not align with the vision and goals of Qiskit Nature. Its "
"status was more of a prototype than a continuously developing feature "
"like the other parts of the package and on top of that it is really more "
"a chemistry-inspired *optimization problem* which is not something that "
"is currently in the scope of Qiskit Nature."

"Thus, the entire code related to protein folding has been migrated to the"
" `Qiskit Research repository <https://github.com/qiskit-research/qiskit-"
"research>`__ from where you can still install and use it, just like you "
"have done so far, except with the new import locations based on that "
"package."
