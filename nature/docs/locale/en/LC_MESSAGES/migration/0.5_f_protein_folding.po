"The keen-eyed among you will have already noticed in the `overview of the"
" design of Qiskit Nature <./0.5_a_intro.ipynb>`__ that protein folding "
"was not mentioned at all. The reason for that is simply that it does not "
"align with the vision and goals of Qiskit Nature. Its status was more of "
"a prototype than a continuously developing feature like the other parts "
"of the package and on top of that it is really more a chemistry-inspired "
"*optimization problem* which is not something that is currently in the "
"scope of Qiskit Nature."

"Thus, the entire code related to protein folding has been migrated to the"
" `Qiskit Research repository <https://github.com/qiskit-research/qiskit-"
"research>`__ from where you can still install and use it, just like you "
"have done so far, except with the new import locations based on that "
"package."
