"When using a :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.UVCC`-style "
"ansatz with a :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.VQE` one "
"needs to pay particular attention to the "
":attr:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.VQE.initial_point` "
"attribute which indicates from which set of initial parameters the "
"optimization routine should start. By default, VQE will start from a "
"*random* initial point. In this how to we show how one can set a custom "
"initial point instead (for example to guarantee that one starts from the "
"VSCF state)."

"Now comes the key step: choosing the initial point. Since we picked the "
":class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.VSCF` initial state "
"before, in order to ensure we start from that, we need to initialize our "
"``initial_point`` with all-zero parameters. One way to do that is like "
