"**Qiskit Nature** is an open-source framework which supports solving "
"quantum mechanical natural science problems using quantum computing "
"algorithms. This includes finding ground and excited states of electronic"
" and vibrational structure problems, measuring the dipole moments of "
"molecular systems, solving the Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models on "
"lattices, and much more."

"The code comprises chemistry drivers, which when provided with a "
"molecular configuration will return one- and two-body integrals as well "
"as other data that is efficiently computed classically. This output data "
"from a driver can then be used as input in Qiskit Nature that contains "
"logic which is able to translate this into a form that is suitable for "
"quantum algorithms."

"For the solution of electronic structure problems, the problem "
"Hamiltonian is first expressed in the second quantization formalism, "
"comprising fermionic excitation and annihilation operators. These can "
"then be mapped to the qubit formalism using a variety of mappings such as"
" Jordan-Wigner, Parity, and more, in readiness for the quantum "
"computation."
