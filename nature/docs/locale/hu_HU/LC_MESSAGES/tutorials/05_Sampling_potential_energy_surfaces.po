msgid "This interactive notebook demonstrates how to utilize the Potential Energy Surface (PES) samplers algorithm of Qiskit Nature to generate the dissociation profile of a molecule. We use the Born-Oppenheimer Potential Energy Surface (BOPES) and demonstrate how to exploit bootstrapping and extrapolation to reduce the total number of function evaluations in computing the PES using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)."

By default, if boostrapping is set to True, all previous optimal parameters are used as initial points for the next runs."
