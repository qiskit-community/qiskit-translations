msgid "The structure and function of many natural and human-engineered proteins is still only poorly understood. As a result, our understanding of processes connected with protein folding, such as those encountered in Alzheimer’s disease, vaccine development, and crop improvement research, has remained limited."

#: ../../tutorials/09_Protein_Folding.ipynb:34
msgid "Unfolded polypeptides have a very large number of degrees of freedom and thus an enormous number of potential conformations. For example, a chain with :math:`100` aminoacids has on the order of :math:`10^{47}` conformations. In reality, however, many proteins fold to their native structure within seconds. This is known as Levinthal’s paradox [1]."

msgid "The problem that we are tackling has now implemented all the physical constraints and has a diagonal Hamiltonian. For the particular case we are targeting the single bitstring that gives us the minimum energy (corresponding to the folded structure of the protein). Thus, we can use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) expectation values for the solution of the problem and for finding the minimum configuration energy [6] . We follow the same approach as in Ref. [2] but here we use COBYLA for the classical optimization part. One can also use the standard VQE or QAOA algorithm for the solution of the problem, though as discussed in Ref. [2] CVaR is more suitable."
