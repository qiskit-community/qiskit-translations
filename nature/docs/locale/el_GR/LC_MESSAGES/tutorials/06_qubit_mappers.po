msgid "The problems and operators with which you interact in Qiskit Nature (usually) need to be mapped into the qubit space before they can be solved with our quantum algorithms. This task is handled by our ``QubitConverter`` as well as the various ``QubitMapper`` classes."

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:241
msgid "The Parity mapping is the dual mapping to the Jordan-Wigner one, in the sense that it encodes the parity information locally on one qubit, whereas the occupation information is delocalized over all qubits."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:341
msgid "This has one major benefit for the case of problems in which we want to preserve the number of particles of each spin species; it allows us to remove 2 qubits, because the information in them becomes redundant. Since Qiskit Nature arranges the qubits in block-order, such that the first half encodes the alpha-spin, and the second half the beta-spin information, this means we can remove the N/2-th and N-th qubit."

#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:425
msgid "The ``QubitConverter`` also enables you to perform more advanced qubit reductions, which are based on finding Z2 symmetries in the Hilbert space of the qubit. A requirement for this to be useful, is that you know in which symmetry-subspace you need to look for your actual solution of interest. This can be a bit tricky, but luckily the problem classes of Qiskit Nature provide you with a utility to automatically determine that correct subspace."

#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:497
msgid "There are multiple reasons for its existence: - it handles the qubit reduction techniques which are applied on the qubit space *after* the mapping process - it **stores** the symmetry information which you find during the conversion of your *Hamiltonian* such that you can recall and use the same symmetry reductions when mapping additional observables later on"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:499
msgid "This last point is especially important, since you would otherwise obtain qubit operators of different sizes, which will be incompatible when trying to evaluate them at your solution state."
