msgid "``ElectronicEnergy`` is arguably the most important property because it contains the *Hamiltonian* representing the electronic structure problem whose eigenvalues we are interested in when solving an ``ElectronicStructureProblem``. The way in which it stores this Hamiltonian is, just like the rest of the framework, highly modular. The initializer of the ``ElectronicEnergy`` has a single required argument, ``electronic_integrals``, which is a ``List[ElectronicIntegrals]``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/08_property_framework.ipynb:361
msgid "As you can see, the first argument simply specifies the basis of the integrals. The second argument requires a little further explanation:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/08_property_framework.ipynb:363
msgid "In the case of the ``AO`` or ``MO`` basis, this argument **must** be a pair of numpy arrays, where the first and second one are the alpha- and beta-spin integrals, respectively."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/08_property_framework.ipynb:365
msgid "**Note:** The second argument may be ``None``, for the case where the beta-spin integrals are the same as the alpha-spin integrals (so there is no need to provide the same values twice)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/08_property_framework.ipynb:367

msgid "Result interpretation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/08_property_framework.ipynb:721
msgid "An additional benefit which we gain from the ``Property`` framework, is that the result interpretation of a computed eigenvalue can be handled by each property itself. This results in nice and logically consistent classes because the result gets interpreted in the same context where the raw data is available."

#: ../../tutorials/08_property_framework.ipynb:1640
msgid "You can extend the Property framework with your own implementations. Here, we will walk through the simple example of constructing a Property for the *electronic density*. Since this observable is essentially based on matrices, we will be leveraging the ``OneBodyElectronicIntegrals`` container to store the actual density matrix."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/08_property_framework.ipynb:1821
msgid "Of course, the above example is very minimal and can be extended at will."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/08_property_framework.ipynb:1832
msgid "**Note:** as of Qiskit Nature version 0.2.0, the direct integration of custom Property objects into the stack is not implemented yet, due to limitations of the auxiliary operator parsing. See https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/issues/312 for more details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/08_property_framework.ipynb:1834
msgid "For the time being, you can still evaluate a custom Property, by passing it’s generated operators directly to the ``Eigensolver.solve`` method by means of constructing the ``aux_operators``. Note, however, that you will have to deal with transformations applied to your properties manually, until the above issue is resolved."
