msgid "Qiskit Nature depends on the main Qiskit package which has its own `Qiskit Getting Started <https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html>`__ detailing the installation options for Qiskit and its supported environments/platforms. You should refer to that first. Then the information here can be followed which focuses on the additional installation specific to Qiskit Nature."

msgid "Qiskit Nature has some functions that have been made optional where the dependent code and/or support program(s) are not (or cannot be) installed by default. These include, for example, classical library/programs for molecular problems. See :ref:`optional_installs` for more information."

msgid "Qiskit Nature supports the use of different classical libraries and programs, via drivers, which compute molecular information, such as one and two body integrals. This is needed as problem input to algorithms that compute properties of molecules, such as the ground state energy, so at least one such library/program should be installed. As you can choose which driver you use, you can install as many, or as few as you wish, that are supported by your platform etc."
