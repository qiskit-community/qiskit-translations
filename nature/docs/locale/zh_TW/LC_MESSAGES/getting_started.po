msgid "Qiskit Nature depends on the main Qiskit package which has its own `Qiskit Getting Started <https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html>`__ detailing the installation options for Qiskit and its supported environments/platforms. You should refer to that first. Then the information here can be followed which focuses on the additional installation specific to Qiskit Nature."

msgid "Qiskit Nature has some functions that have been made optional where the dependent code and/or support program(s) are not (or cannot be) installed by default. These include, for example, classical library/programs for molecular problems. See :ref:`optional_installs` for more information."

This will give you the ability to inspect and extend the latest version of the Qiskit Nature code more efficiently."

msgid "Since Qiskit Nature depends on Qiskit, and its latest changes may require new or changed features of Qiskit, you should first follow Qiskit's `\"Install from source\"` instructions here `Qiskit Getting Started <https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html>`__"

msgid "Qiskit Nature supports the use of different classical libraries and programs, via drivers, which compute molecular information, such as one and two body integrals. This is needed as problem input to algorithms that compute properties of molecules, such as the ground state energy, so at least one such library/program should be installed. As you can choose which driver you use, you can install as many, or as few as you wish, that are supported by your platform etc."

msgid "The program above computes the ground state energy of molecular Hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>, where the two atoms are configured to be at a distance of 0.735 angstroms. The molecular input specification is processed by the PySCF driver. This driver produces an :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem` which gathers all the problem information required by Qiskit Nature. The second-quantized operators contained in that problem can be mapped to qubit operators with a :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper`. Here, we chose the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.ParityMapper` which automatically removes 2 qubits due to inherit symmetries when the `num_particles` are provided to it; a reduction in complexity that is particularly advantageous for NISQ computers."

#: ../../getting_started.rst:221
msgid "For actually finding the ground state solution, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (:class:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.VQE`) algorithm is used. Its main three components are the estimator primitive (:class:`~qiskit.primitives.Estimator`), wavefunction ansatz (:class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.UCCSD`), and optimizer (:class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.L_BFGS_B`). The :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.UCCSD` component is the only one provided directly by Qiskit Nature and it is usually paired with the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.HartreeFock` initial state and an all-zero initial point for the optimizer."

msgid "The entire problem is then solved using a :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.GroundStateEigensolver` which wraps both, the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.ParityMapper` and :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.VQE`. Since an :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem` is provided to it (which was the output of the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.drivers.PySCFDriver`) it also returns an :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureResult`."
