#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:186

#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:286
msgid "This has one major benefit for the case of problems in which we want to preserve the number of particles of each spin species; it allows us to remove 2 qubits, because the information in them becomes redundant. Since Qiskit Nature arranges the qubits in block-order, such that the first half encodes the alpha-spin, and the second half the beta-spin information, this means we can remove the N/2-th and N-th qubit."

#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:359
msgid "It is also possible to perform more advanced qubit reductions, which are based on finding Z2 symmetries in the Hilbert space of the qubit. A requirement for this to be useful, is that you know in which symmetry-subspace you need to look for your actual solution of interest. This can be a bit tricky, but luckily the problem classes of Qiskit Nature provide you with a utility to automatically determine that correct subspace."

msgid "As mentioned previously, Qiskit Nature arranges the fermionic spin-up and spin-down parts of the qubit register in block-order. However, sometimes one may want to interleave the registers instead. This can be achieved by means of the ``InterleavedQubitMapper``. This can be shown best upon inspection of the ``HarteeFock`` initial state circuit:"
