msgid "The :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitConverter` class has been deprecated as part of version 0.6 of Qiskit Nature. Instead of wrapping this class around one of the available :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper` classes, the latter can now instead be used directly. To support this, the mappers have been improved and now ship with more advanced functionality out of the box."

In order to transition from the :class:`~qiskit.opflow.primitive_ops.PauliSumOp` class and its widespread use to the :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` module and its :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp` class, you can now set the value of :attr:`~qiskit_nature.settings.QiskitNatureSettings.use_pauli_sum_op` to ``False``.
