msgid "In this tutorial we are going to discuss the excited states calculation interface of Qiskit Nature. The goal is to compute the excited states of a molecular Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian can be electronic or vibrational. To know more about the preparation of the Hamiltonian, check out the `Electronic structure <01_electronic_structure.ipynb>`__ and `Vibrational structure tutorials <02_vibrational_structure.ipynb>`__."

msgid "Let’s first start with a purely classical example: the ``NumPyEigensolver``. This algorithm exactly diagonalizes the Hamiltonian. Although it scales badly, it can be used on small systems to check the results of the quantum algorithms. Here, we are only interested to look at eigenstates with a given number of particle. To compute only those states a filter function can be passed to the ``NumPyEigensolver``. A default filter function is already implemented in Qiskit Nature and will be extracted automatically, if you enable the ``use_default_filter_criterion`` setting like so:"

The EOM method finds the excitation energies (differences in energy between the ground state and all :math:`n`\\ th excited states) by solving the following pseudo-eigenvalue problem."

msgid "One can see from these results that one state is missing from the NumPy results. The reason for this is because the spin is also used as a filter and only singlet states are shown. In the following we use a custom filter function to check our results consistently and only filter out states with the incorrect number of particles (in this case the number of particle is 2)."
