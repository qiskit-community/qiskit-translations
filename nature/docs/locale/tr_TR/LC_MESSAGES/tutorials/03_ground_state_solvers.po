This Hamiltonian can for example be electronic or vibrational. To know more about the preparation of the Hamiltonian, check out the `Electronic structure <01_electronic_structure.ipynb>`__ and `Vibrational structure tutorials <02_vibrational_structure.ipynb>`__."

msgid "A variational form: here we use the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz (see for instance [Physical Review A 98.2 (2018): 022322]). Since it is a chemistry standard, a factory is already available allowing a fast initialization of a VQE with UCC. The default is to use all single and double excitations. However, the excitation type (S, D, SD) as well as other parameters can be selected. Since we are using the ``VQEUCCFactory``, this will also prepend the ``UCCSD`` variational form with a ``HartreeFock`` initial state, which initializes the occupation of our qubits according to the problem which we are trying solve."

msgid "Sometimes the true ground state of the Hamiltonian is not of interest because it lies in a different symmetry sector of the Hilbert space. In this case the ``NumPyEigensolver`` can take a filter function to return only the eigenstates with for example the correct number of particles. This is of particular importance in the case of vibrational structure calculations where the true ground state of the Hamiltonian is the vacuum state. A default filter function to check the number of particles is implemented in the different problems and can be used as follows:"
