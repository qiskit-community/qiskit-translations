msgid "The major focus of the Qiskit Nature v0.5 refactoring was the description and representation of second-quantized operators and problems. Nonetheless, the ``algorithms`` module and supporting modules did also receive significant updates. Most importantly all algorithms In Nature are now dependent on the new Qiskit Terra algorithms, and these are now based on `Qiskit Primitives <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/primitives.html>`__ and were added in Qiskit Terra 0.22. It is not the intention to provide detailed explanations of the primitives in this migration guide. We suggest that you read the `corresponding resources <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/primitives.html>`__ of the Qiskit Terra documentation instead."
