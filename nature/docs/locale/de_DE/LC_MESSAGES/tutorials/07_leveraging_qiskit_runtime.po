msgid "If we send hundreds of jobs iteratively, this overhead quickly dominates the execution time of our algorithm. Qiskit Runtime allows us to tackle these issues and significantly speed up (especially) iterative algorithms. With Qiskit Runtime, one job does not contain only a batch of circuits but the *entire* algorithm. That means we only experience the API overhead and queue wait *once* instead of in every iteration! You’ll be able to either upload algorithm parameters and delegate all the complexity to the cloud, where your program is executed, or upload your personal algorithm directly."
