This noise can adversely impact the results and hence can limit the sort of problems we can currently tackle when, due to the noise, a high level of confidence and precision cannot be expected from the results."

msgid "Fortunately, in Qiskit Nature we have tools to define fermionic operators and to convert this kind of operators into Pauli operators through the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Initially, we use a for loop to construct and store the labels and coefficients in a tuple, and after this, we add the tuple in a list. Each string label and coefficient define a kinetic element :math:`\\langle m|T|n\\rangle` and a potential element :math:`\\langle m|V|n\\rangle` of the Hamiltonian. At the end of the for loop, we have to pass the list with the tuples with labels and coefficients to ``FermionicOp``, in order to create a Hamiltonian in terms of the creation and annihilation operators. We need to rewrite this Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli operators, to do this we use ``JordanWignerMapper()`` and the ``QubitConverter()``. In order to obtain more information about the Qiskit Nature tools, we recommend a reading of the Qiskit Nature documentation `[2] <https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/>`__."
