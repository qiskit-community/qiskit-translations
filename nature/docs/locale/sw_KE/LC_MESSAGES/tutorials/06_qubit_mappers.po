msgid "The problems and operators with which you interact in Qiskit Nature (usually) need to be mapped into the qubit space before they can be solved with our quantum algorithms. This task is handled by the various ``QubitMapper`` classes."

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:186
msgid "The Parity mapping is the dual mapping to the Jordan-Wigner one, in the sense that it encodes the parity information locally on one qubit, whereas the occupation information is delocalized over all qubits."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:286
msgid "This has one major benefit for the case of problems in which we want to preserve the number of particles of each spin species; it allows us to remove 2 qubits, because the information in them becomes redundant. Since Qiskit Nature arranges the qubits in block-order, such that the first half encodes the alpha-spin, and the second half the beta-spin information, this means we can remove the N/2-th and N-th qubit."

#: ../../tutorials/06_qubit_mappers.ipynb:359
msgid "It is also possible to perform more advanced qubit reductions, which are based on finding Z2 symmetries in the Hilbert space of the qubit. A requirement for this to be useful, is that you know in which symmetry-subspace you need to look for your actual solution of interest. This can be a bit tricky, but luckily the problem classes of Qiskit Nature provide you with a utility to automatically determine that correct subspace."

msgid "As mentioned previously, Qiskit Nature arranges the fermionic spin-up and spin-down parts of the qubit register in block-order. However, sometimes one may want to interleave the registers instead. This can be achieved by means of the ``InterleavedQubitMapper``. This can be shown best upon inspection of the ``HarteeFock`` initial state circuit:"
