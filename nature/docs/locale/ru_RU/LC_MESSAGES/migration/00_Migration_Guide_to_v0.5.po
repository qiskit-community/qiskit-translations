msgid "Let us begin with an overview of the refactored design. A major motivator for the refactoring of Qiskit Nature was the goal of readying Qiskit Nature for more and tighter integrations with other classical-computational codes. In order to achieve this in the most modular and maintainable manner, we had to decouple the representation of our ``BaseProblem`` from our ``BaseDriver`` classes."

This should help you navigate the source code for most cases.

msgid "With Qiskit Nature v0.5 we have switched the entire stack over from using ``num_spin_orbitals`` to instead use ``num_spatial_orbitals``. The motivation behind this, was that the behavior when specifying an odd number of spin orbitals was ill-defined and not guarded against, potentially causing surprising results. By switching to the number of spatial orbitals (which then get multiplied by 2 to yield the total number of spin orbitals), this problem can no longer arise."
