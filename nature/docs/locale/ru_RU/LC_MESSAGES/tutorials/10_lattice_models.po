msgid "In quantum physics (including condensed matter physics and high energy physics) we often study models on lattices. For example, when we think about behavior of electrons in a solid, we can study a model defined on a lattice by considering the positions of atoms as lattice points. This notebook demonstrates how we can utilize ``Lattice`` classes to generate various lattice systems such as ``LineLattice``, ``SquareLattice``, ``HyperCubicLattice``, ``TriangularLattice``, and a general lattice. It also includes an example of a lattice model, the Fermi-Hubbard model. We see how we can define the Hamiltonian of the Fermi-Hubbard model for a given lattice using ``FermiHubbardModel`` class."
