msgid "the job queue time, that is how long you have to wait before it’s your turn to run on the device (usually about 2min)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/07_leveraging_qiskit_runtime.ipynb:25
msgid "If we send hundreds of jobs iteratively, this overhead quickly dominates the execution time of our algorithm. Qiskit Runtime allows us to tackle these issues and significantly speed up (especially) iterative algorithms. With Qiskit Runtime, one job does not contain only a batch of circuits but the *entire* algorithm. That means we only experience the API overhead and queue wait *once* instead of in every iteration! You’ll be able to either upload algorithm parameters and delegate all the complexity to the cloud, where your program is executed, or upload your personal algorithm directly."

msgid "If we are interested in the development of the energy, the ``VQEClient`` allows access to the history of the optimizer, which contains the loss per iteration (along with the parameters and a timestamp). Note that this only holds for the SPSA and QN-SPSA optimizers. Otherwise you have to use a callback to the ``VQEClient``, similar to the normal ``VQE``."
