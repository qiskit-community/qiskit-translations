msgid "Sometimes the true ground state of the Hamiltonian is not of interest because it lies in a different symmetry sector of the Hilbert space. In this case the NumPy eigensolver can take a filter function to return only the eigenstates with for example the correct number of particles. This is of particular importance in the case of vibrational structure calculations where the true ground state of the Hamiltonian is the vacuum state. A default filter function to check the number of particles is implemented in the different transformations and can be used as"
