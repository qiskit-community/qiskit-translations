msgid "Let us begin with an overview of the refactored design. A major motivator for the refactoring of Qiskit Nature was the goal of readying Qiskit Nature for more and tighter integrations with other classical-computational codes. In order to achieve this in the most modular and maintainable manner, we had to decouple the representation of our ``BaseProblem`` from our ``BaseDriver`` classes."

Furthermore, the integration with classical codes has been very restrictive in older versions, limiting not only the potential applications of such integrations, but also the capabilities of our ``BaseProblem`` representation, and its usage in the remainder of the package."

msgid "This guide is split across multiple files allowing you to discover the changes between v0.4 and v0.5 to each submodule as you find the need. That means, you do not need to read all of the details at once and jumping around is highly encouraged."

#: ../../migration/0.5_a_intro.rst:61
msgid "Generally speaking the refactoring largely relocated any code from ``qiskit_nature.X.second_quantization`` to ``qiskit_nature.second_q.X``. This should help you navigate the source code for most cases. However, in some specific cases we have re-categorized specific modules/classes, so be advised to look into the guides for more details below."

msgstr ""

#: ../../migration/0.5_a_intro.rst:148
msgid "With Qiskit Nature v0.5 we have switched the entire stack over from using ``num_spin_orbitals`` to instead use ``num_spatial_orbitals``. The motivation behind this, was that the behavior when specifying an odd number of spin orbitals was ill-defined and not guarded against, potentially causing surprising results. By switching to the number of spatial orbitals (which then get multiplied by 2 to yield the total number of spin orbitals), this problem can no longer arise."
msgstr ""

msgid "So if you do encounter some unexpected number of orbitals and/or qubits in your results, be sure to check whether you need to update your input. For example like shown below:"
