The choice of using :math:`\\pm 1` variables instead of :math:`0/1` variables is not important, but will be convenient in terms of notation when we begin to re-cast this problem in terms of quantum observables. We will be primarily interested in `quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization>`__ problems, although the ideas in this document can readily extend to problems with more than quadratic terms, and problems with non-binary or constrained variables can often be recast as a QUBO (though this conversion will incur some overhead)."

msgid "Within mathematical optimization, `relaxation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_%28approximation%29>`__ is the strategy of taking some hard problem and mapping it onto a similar version of that problem which is (usually) easier to solve. The core idea here is that for useful relaxations, the solution to the relaxed problem can give information about the original problem and allow one to heuristically find better solutions. An example of relaxation could be something as simple as taking a discrete optimization problem and allowing a solver to optimize the problem using continuous variables. Once a solution is obtained for the relaxed problem, the solver must find a strategy for extracting a discrete solution from the relaxed solution of continuous values. This process of mapping the relaxed solution back onto original problem’s set of admissible solutions is often referred to as **rounding**."
