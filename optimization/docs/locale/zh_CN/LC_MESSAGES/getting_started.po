msgid "Qiskit Optimization depends on the main Qiskit package which has its own `Qiskit Getting Started <https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html>`__ detailing the installation options for Qiskit and its supported environments/platforms. You should refer to that first. Then the information here can be followed which focuses on the additional installation specific to Qiskit Optimization."
