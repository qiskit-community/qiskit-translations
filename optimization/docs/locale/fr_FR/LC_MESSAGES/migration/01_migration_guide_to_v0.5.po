Note that ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` cannot basically handle ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.MinimumEigensolver`` of the new algorithms. But there is an exception. ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` can handle ``algorithms.minimum_eigensolver.NumPyMinimumEigensolver`` though it inherits ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.MinimumEigensolver``. It is because ``algorithms.minimum_eigensolver.NumPyMinimumEigensolver`` has an extension that allows users to access the eigen states."
