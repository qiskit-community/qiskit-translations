msgid "An interesting class of optimization problems to be addressed by quantum computing are Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. Finding the solution to a QUBO is equivalent to finding the ground state of a corresponding Ising Hamiltonian, which is an important problem not only in optimization, but also in quantum chemistry and physics. For this translation, the binary variables taking values in :math:`\\{0, 1\\}` are replaced by spin variables taking values in :math:`\\{-1, +1\\}`, which allows one to replace the resulting spin variables by Pauli Z matrices, and thus, an Ising Hamiltonian. For more details on this mapping we refer to [1]."

msgid "In the following we first illustrate the conversion from a ``QuadraticProgram`` to an ``Operator`` and then show how to use the ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` with different ``MinimumEigensolver``\\ s to solve a given ``QuadraticProgram``. The algorithms in Qiskit automatically try to convert a given problem to the supported problem class if possible, for instance, the ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` will automatically translate integer variables to binary variables or add linear equality constraints as a quadratic penalty term to the objective. It should be mentioned that a ``QiskitOptimizationError`` will be thrown if conversion of a quadratic program with integer variables is attempted."

A possible workaround is Recursive QAOA, as introduced in [2]. Qiskit generalizes this concept to the ``RecursiveMinimumEigenOptimizer``, which is introduced at the end of this tutorial."
