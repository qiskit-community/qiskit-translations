msgid "Optimization problems in Qiskit’s optimization module are represented with the ``QuadraticProgram`` class, which is generic and powerful representation for optimization problems. In general, optimization algorithms are defined for a certain formulation of a quadratic program and we need to convert our problem to the right type."

msgid "For instance, Qiskit provides several optimization algorithms that can handle Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. These are mapped to Ising Hamiltonians, for which Qiskit uses the ``qiskit.aqua.operators`` module, and then their ground state is approximated. For this optimization commonly known algorithms such as VQE or QAOA can be used as underlying routine. See the following tutorial about the `Minimum Eigen Optimizer <./03_minimum_eigen_optimizer.ipynb>`__ for more detail. Note that also other algorithms exist that work differently, such as the ``GroverOptimizer``."

msgid "To map a problem to the correct input format, the optimization module of Qiskit offers a variety of converters. In this tutorial we’re providing an overview on this functionality. Currently, Qiskit contains the following converters. - ``InequalityToEquality``: converts inequality constraints into equality constraints with additional slack variables. - ``IntegerToBinary``: converts integer variables into binary variables and corresponding coefficients. - ``LinearEqualityToPenalty``: convert equality constraints into additional terms of the object function. - ``QuadraticProgramToQubo``: a wrapper for ``InequalityToEquality``, ``IntegerToBinary``, and ``LinearEqualityToPenalty`` for convenience."

msgid "``InequalityToEqualityConverter`` converts inequality constraints into equality constraints with additional slack variables to remove inequality constraints from ``QuadraticProgram``. The upper bounds and the lower bounds of slack variables will be calculated from the difference between the left sides and the right sides of constraints. Signs of slack variables depend on symbols in constraints such as :math:`\\leq` and :math:`\\geq`."

msgid "Let us explain how the conversion works. For example, the lower bound of the left side of the first constraint is :math:`0` which is the case of :math:`x=0`, :math:`y=0`, and :math:`z=0`. Thus, the upperbound of the additional integer variable must be :math:`5` to be able to satisfy even the case of :math:`x=0`, :math:`y=0`, and :math:`z=0`. Note that we cut off the part after the decimal point in the converted formulation since the left side of the first constraint in the original formulation can be only integer values. For the second constraint, basically we apply the same approach. However, the symbol in the second constraint is :math:`\\geq`, so we add minus before :math:`xyz\\_geq\\text{@}int\\_slack` to be able to satisfy even the case of :math:`x=1, y=1`, and :math:`z=7`."

Those equality constraints, e.g. \\ :math:`\\sum_i a_i x_i = b` where :math:`a_i` and :math:`b` are numbers and :math:`x_i` is a variable, will be added to the objective function in the form of :math:`M(b - \\sum_i a_i x_i)^2` where :math:`M` is a large number as penalty factor.
