msgid "Logistics is a major industry, with some estimates valuing it at USD 8183 billion globally in 2015. Most service providers operate a number of vehicles (e.g., trucks and container ships), a number of depots, where the vehicles are based overnight, and serve a number of client locations with each vehicle during each day. There are many optimization and control problems that consider these parameters. Computationally, the key challenge is how to design routes from depots to a number of client locations and back to the depot, so as to minimize vehicle-miles traveled, time spent, or similar objective functions. In this notebook we formalize an idealized version of the problem and showcase its solution using the quantum approximate optimization approach of Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann (2014)."
