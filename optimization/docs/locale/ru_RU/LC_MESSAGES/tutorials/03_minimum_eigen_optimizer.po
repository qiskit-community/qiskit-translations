msgid "An interesting class of optimization problems to be addressed by quantum computing are Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. Finding the solution to a QUBO is equivalent to finding the ground state of a corresponding Ising Hamiltonian, which is an important problem not only in optimization, but also in quantum chemistry and physics. For this translation, the binary variables taking values in :math:`\\{0, 1\\}` are replaced by spin variables taking values in :math:`\\{-1, +1\\}`, which allows one to replace the resulting spin variables by Pauli Z matrices, and thus, an Ising Hamiltonian. For more details on this mapping we refer to [1]."

The algorithms in Qiskit automatically try to convert a given problem to the supported problem class if possible, for instance, the ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` will automatically translate integer variables to binary variables or add linear equality constraints as a quadratic penalty term to the objective. It should be mentioned that a ``QiskitOptimizationError`` will be thrown if conversion of a quadratic program with integer variables is attempted."
