msgid "Qiskit Optimization depends on the main Qiskit package which has its own `Qiskit Getting Started <https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html>`__ detailing the installation options for Qiskit and its supported environments/platforms. You should refer to that first. Then the information here can be followed which focuses on the additional installation specific to Qiskit Optimization."

msgid "Qiskit Optimization has some functions that have been made optional where the dependent code and/or support program(s) are not (or cannot be) installed by default. Those are IBM CPLEX, CVXPY and Matplotlib. See :ref:`optional_installs` for more information."
