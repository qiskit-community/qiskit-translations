"This notebook shows how to use the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) "
"objective function introduced in [1] within the variational quantum "
"optimization algorithms provided by `Qiskit Algorithms "
"<https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/algorithms/>`__. Particularly, it is shown "
"how to setup the ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` using ``SamplingVQE`` "
"accordingly. For a given set of shots with corresponding objective values"
" of the considered optimization problem, the CVaR with confidence level "
":math:`\\alpha \\in [0, 1]` is defined as the average of the "
":math:`\\alpha` best shots. Thus, :math:`\\alpha = 1` corresponds to the "
"standard expected value, while :math:`\\alpha=0` corresponds to the "
"minimum of the given shots, and :math:`\\alpha \\in (0, 1)` is a tradeoff"
" between focusing on better shots, but still applying some averaging to "
"smoothen the optimization landscape."
