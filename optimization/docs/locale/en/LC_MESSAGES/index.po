"**Qiskit Optimization** is an open-source framework that covers the whole"
" range from high-level modeling of optimization problems, with automatic "
"conversion of problems to different required representations, to a suite "
"of easy-to-use quantum optimization algorithms that are ready to run on "
"classical simulators, as well as on real quantum devices via Qiskit."

"The Optimization module enables easy, efficient modeling of optimization "
"problems using `docplex <https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io"
"/docplex-doc/>`__. A uniform interface as well as automatic conversion "
"between different problem representations allows users to solve problems "
"using a large set of algorithms, from variational quantum algorithms, "
"such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA, to Grover "
"Adaptive Search using the GroverOptimizer leveraging fundamental "
"algorithms provided by Terra. Furthermore, the modular design of the "
"optimization module allows it to be easily extended and facilitates rapid"
" development and testing of new algorithms. Compatible classical "
"optimizers are also provided for testing, validation, and benchmarking."
