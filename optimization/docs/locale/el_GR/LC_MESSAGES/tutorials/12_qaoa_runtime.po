msgid "The Qiskit runtime is an execution model that permits us to run an entire program on the backend side. Here, we discuss how to run the QAOA algorithm in the Qiskit runtime. We will discuss several of the features that this first version of the QAOA Runtime makes available."

#: ../../tutorials/12_qaoa_runtime.ipynb:154
msgid "**operator** is by far the most important argument since it represent the cost operator that we want to minimize. For QAOA this corresponds to a ``PauliSumOp``. Each time there is a quadratic term between two decision variables in the problem we wish to minimize there will be a corresponding ``ZZ`` term in the ``PauliSumOp``. For example, the operator ``PauliSumOp.from_list([(\"ZIZ\", 1), (\"IZZ\", -1), (\"ZZI\", 1)])`` may correspond to a Maxcut problem on a triangle where one edge has a negative weight."

msgid "**alpha** is the :math:`\\alpha` of the CVaR optimization [1]. If :math:`\\alpha` is smaller than one then only the best :math:`\\alpha` fraction of shots will be retained in the optimization, i.e. this corresponds to using ``CVaRExpectation(alpha, PauliExpectation())`` which can be found in ``qiskit.opflow``."

msgid "If **use_swap_strategies** is ``True`` the QAOA program will transpile the QAOA circuit with dedicated swap strategies that take into account the commutative nature of the ``ZZ`` operators in QAOA and the coupling map of the backend on which the program will run. If this option is False then the QAOA program will default to the standard transpiler with optimization level 1. This optimization level can be chosen using the **optimization_level** input option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/12_qaoa_runtime.ipynb:163
msgid "If **use_pulse_efficient** is set to ``True`` then a pulse efficient transpilation will be run at each QAOA iteration [2]. This collects two-qubit blocks and applies Cartan's KAK decomposition to obtain a ``RZXGate`` representation of the circuit. Scaled cross-resonance pulses are then used. Further details are given in Appendix A below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/12_qaoa_runtime.ipynb:164
msgid "If **use_initial_mapping** is ``True`` then a heuristic algorithm will be run to permute the Pauli operators in the cost operator to better fit the coupling map of the device. This permutation is only applied if the ``use_swap_strategies`` option is set to ``True`` and only makes sense for non-fully-connected problems."
